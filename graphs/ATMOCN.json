Consider different methods to study the cryosphere and its role in the climate system, such as remote sensing and in situ observations, state estimates and reanalyses, with a particular focus on idealized and comprehensive global climate models. Covers fundamental physical concepts as well as unresolved research questions such as the debates surrounding potential instabilities in the climate system and uncertainties in future projections of ice loss, teleconnections, and sea level rise.",
