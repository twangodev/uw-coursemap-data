Addresses questions like: Where do linguistic myths, especially those regarding varieties of American English used by persistently marginalized groups, come from and how does one check if there is a factual basis for them? Who gets to decide which words are entered into a dictionary or what constitutes 'proper' English? What perceptions do people have about 'good' and 'bad' dialects and accents? Who benefits and who is harmed by such perceptions? Approaches these and related questions within an anti-racist framework, showing that perceptions towards certain English varieties are often not grounded in linguistic facts but rather in bias against certain demographic groups.",

From marriage licenses, passports, and don't ask, don't tell policies to literacy requirements and gag rules, written texts have played major roles in enforcing expectations about race and sex in the United States. At the same time, anti-slavery petitions, letters to the editor, wheat-pasted posters, and hashtag activism all also harness the power of writing to challenge and revise those expectations. In light of that active textual production and negotiation, this class traces public debates and daily experiences where people write or talk about race and sex in order to make a difference. Ultimately, the class takes on the power of words to break bones and heal wounds. Through reading and writing informed by scholarship in writing studies and rhetoric, students in this class will examine historical and contemporary interconnections among race, sexuality, gender, and texts in the United States, developing analytical tools for understanding how language works on and in their world.",
