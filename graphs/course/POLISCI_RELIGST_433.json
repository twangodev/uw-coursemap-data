Investigate the implications of the various ways in which the religion-state relationship have been involved in political conflict. Building on this, turn to several of the current issues in religion and politics asking: Why is religion apparently more important than ever despite an increasingly secular world? What is religious nationalism? What is fundamentalism? How can we explain the similarities and differences between religious fundamentalist movements across the globe? How should democratic states cope with the emergence of fundamentalist movements? In order to begin answering these questions,  integrate the theoretical frameworks we develop with explorations of the historical and local context of relevant case-studies from around the world.",
