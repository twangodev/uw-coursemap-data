            "description": "Should all individuals in society receive a regular transfer of cash from the state without any strings attached? If that question had been posed fifteen years ago, it would likely have been dismissed as unrealistic, undesirable, or just plain crazy. In recent years, however, the idea of introducing a universal basic income [UBI] has gained a lot of traction around the world. Growing inequalities, financial crises, fears about jobs being automated, and the COVID-19 pandemic have all helped to put UBI on the political map. But where did the idea come from? How is it traveling to different parts of the world? And on what grounds do different advocates justify their claims? Address these questions and more by exploring the history, philosophy, and political economy of UBI from a range of perspectives. Ongoing UBI experiments from different parts of the world will also be examined.",
