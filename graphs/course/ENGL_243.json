            "description": "Is America a new world, a city on a hill, an imperial power? Are American literatures revolutionary, nationalist, countercultural?  Explores how writers have wrestled with such questions for several hundred years. We will encounter literary figures from white whales to red wheelbarrows, focusing on the diverse geographies, cultural practices, and political mythologies that compose the Americas, and interrogating what is meant by American literature and what it means to be American. We will consider the ways that genres from Native stories to slave narratives to postmodern novels have contributed to social, intellectual, and political currents of American cultures. Develops skills of critical reading and writing that are essential to majors and non-majors alike.",
