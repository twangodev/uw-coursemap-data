A special emphasis will be placed on working with underserved and specific subgroups of smokers (e.g., low-income, racial minorities, mental health status) through specific treatment plans, pharmacotherapy, counseling, including motivational interviewing, and community-based interventions such as quit lines. We will also look at how to use health systems, such as electronic health records in conducting community-participatory research in subpopulations of smokers.",
