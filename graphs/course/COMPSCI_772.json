Both classical (e.g., nearest neighbor, filtering) and modern deep learning based (e.g., ConvNets, GANs, Diffusion Models) algorithms will be presented for image representation, synthesis, and manipulation. Usage of self-developed algorithms for image synthesis and manipulation to understand and analyze state-of-the-art techniques, and to identify interesting open questions and future directions.",
