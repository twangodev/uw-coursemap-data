            "description": "Explore the new frontier of evolutionary and ecological solutions to public health challenges through analyses and discussions. Evolution is often viewed as a purely historical topic disconnected from modern practical concerns. This view is incomplete: evolution plays a key role in many areas of modern life and underlies many public health challenges like drug resistance in bacteria and cancer, vaccine development, circadian medicine, and the 'spill-over' of pathogens from wildlife to humans (and vice versa). These issues, however, are intricately connected to social drivers like the use of antibiotics to treat viruses or as growth promoters in livestock. More evolutionary-guided solutions to understanding and addressing these challenges are critical for a sustainable and healthy future.",
