Variational principles, Hamilton's extended principle, Lagrange's equations, mathematical models for continuous systems, natural modes of vibrations, dynamic response using mode superposition, mode acceleration, residual flexibility, vibration analysis using finite element methods, advanced substructure representations, component mode synthesis, systems with rigid body modes for aeronautical and astronautical systems. Knowledge of vibrations [such asE\u00a0M\u00a0A\u00a0545orM\u00a0E\u00a0440] strongly encouraged.",
