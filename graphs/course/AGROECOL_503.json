Examines the components of agricultural systems and analyzes how different ecological and social contexts influence and are influenced by the agricultural system. Explores and analyzes how management decisions (crop breeding, in-crop management, landscape-level, etc.) ramify to influence processes and outcomes at different levels of complexity (e.g., ecosystem, landscape, social well-being, human health, economic) and the socio-ecological tradeoffs that ensue. Develops skills to analyze how the design and implementation of integrated agricultural systems can contribute to solutions for pressing societal challenges such as climate change, biodiversity declines, unsustainable resource use and social inequality.",
