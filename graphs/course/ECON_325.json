Topics covered include healthcare, education, labor markets, housing and neighborhoods, wealth, and criminal justice, with a focus on aspects of the economy where there are differences in economic outcomes for racial or racial minority groups. Questions include how these differences can result from disparities in how people, markets, or policies treat or impact different groups using economic theory as a foundation, and how economists have studied and measured these differences. In light of the history and range of economic opportunity and change in some communities, particular attention is given to the African American experience.",
