These decisions are key aspects of an organism's life, e.g. foraging behavior, mating behavior, anti-predator behavior, and habitat selection. Approaches these questions with the perspective that understanding the proximal and ultimate basis of behavior requires understanding the ecological and evolutionary context of behavior.",
