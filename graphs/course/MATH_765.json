The following topics will be covered: Vector bundles and connections, Riemannian metrics, submanifolds and second fundamental form, first variation of arc length, geodesics, Hopf-Rinow theorem, second variation of arc length, Jacobi fields and index lemmas, Bonnet-Meyer theorem, Rauch comparison theorem, spaces of constant curvature, Hodge-de Rham theory. Familiarity with the topics in a differential manifolds course (e.g.MATH\u00a0761) is strongly recommended.",
