Most weeks guest lecturers present their own primary research on a specialized topic in evolutionary biology. Seminars include perspectives from genetics, ecology, geoscience, zoology, botany, microbiology, systematics, molecular biology, and integrative research. Some weeks feature special topics and discussions on pedagogical, legal, outreach, or other issues in evolutionary biology. Includes thinking critically about methodology, experimental design and interpretation, and how conclusions are reached in evolutionary biology by reading primary and secondary literature, attending seminars, discussing topics with speakers and other students, and preparing a written report.  The 3-credit version of the course delves deeper into communication of evolutionary biology to researchers, undergraduates, K-12 students, and the general public.",
