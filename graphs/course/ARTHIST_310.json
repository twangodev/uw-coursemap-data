How were the visual propaganda and monumental architecture of the Roman Empire transformed during a millennium of Byzantine (East Roman) rule? These are key questions addressed as we explore the role of architecture and images in religion and imperial politics of the Mediterranean basin between the 3rd and 15th centuries. Other broader topics include the cult of the saints; theories and functions of icons and iconoclasm in Orthodox Christianity; text and image in illuminated manuscripts; multi-sensory aspects of sacred space and ritual;  Byzantium's role in global cultural exchange.",
