Covers dynamical techniques inspired by homogeneous dynamics including the use of Margulis functions to establish quantitative recurrence results; the use of random walks, inspired by work of Benoist and Quint, to prove measure rigidity statements; and the use of Zimmer's theory of the algebraic hull to prove finiteness results.",
