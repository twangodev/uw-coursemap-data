Explores the structure of the traditional Roman household, including the preeminence of the paterfamilias and the challenges that women, children, and/or slaves pose to his notional \"tyranny\". Considers a number of prominent religions that came into conflict with Roman authorities - especially the mystery cults surrounding Bacchus as well as early Christianity. Apply insights from the ancient world to the modern one in our consideration of conspiracies such as the Salem Witch Trials, the Red Scare of the '50s, the Kennedy Assassination, and the Watergate Conspiracy.",
