Students are often overwhelmed and do not absorb material when offered all at once before they begin their regular courses. This format offers fundamental content about conducting research and academic life that is not specific to a given department in the business school, but will help to frame and motivate other studies. This format gives students more time to absorb the content at a point when they can better see how it applies to them.",
