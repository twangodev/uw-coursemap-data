However, this anti-Blackness does not go unanswered in Chicanx and Latinx cultural production. Covers literature, life-writing/autoethnography, visual culture, philosophy/theory, and history that takes up Black Latinx experience and/or that comparatively explores the African American and Latinx convergences, exploring a rich vein of thought and representation in U.S. literatures that is often more transamerican than American and that offers new definitions of both Latinx and Black. Readings on racial paradigms in the Americas, paying attention to the differences between US and Latin American contexts, as well readings on decoloniality, intersectional feminisms, borderlands, and diaspora.",
