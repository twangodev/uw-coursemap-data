            "description": "Explore the world of the ancient Greeks through their painted pottery. Greek pottery offers a uniquely rich imagery of mythology, athletics, domestic scenes, fabulous monsters, drinking parties, and other aspects of Greek life and imagination. They were used by ordinary people, and their use offers insights into their everyday lives and concerns, and a counterbalance to the elite accounts preserved in literature and poetry. Consider the long history of Greek vases from about 800 BC until about 350 BC, and focus on themes such as relationships with the East, myth and epic poetry, narrative, and everyday subjects such as women's lives, death and the afterlife, and the symposium. Make use of the excellent collection of Greek vases in the Chazen Museum, and write research papers using that collection.",
