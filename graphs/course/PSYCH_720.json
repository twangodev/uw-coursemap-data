The content covered can be summarized as neuroscience with direct implications for understanding the neural bases of human behavior, and will include anatomical, cellular, systems, behavioral, neuropsychological, and computational levels of analysis. The emphasis will be on domains of behavior traditionally covered by cognitive psychology and neurology, but with explicit consideration, when applicable, of implications for understanding affect, social behavior, and psychopathology.",
