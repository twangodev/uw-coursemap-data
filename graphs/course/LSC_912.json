A solid understanding of public opinion and communication dynamics surrounding today's controversial science issues requires deep knowledge of core concepts and theories of political polarization, attitudes, and information processing, especially in the context of contemporary digital media environments. Focus on how these concepts and theories are applied in contemporary research on public opinion about science and science-related issues.
