Sports psychiatry as a sub-specialty within psychiatry focuses on diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric illness in athletes. While utilization of psychological approaches to enhance performance can be part of the work of the sports psychiatrist, the emphasis is more on addressing actual mental illness in this population. Sports psychiatry may also involve the use of exercise as a therapeutic or preventative intervention for mental illness. Sports psychiatry typically focuses on mental health care for individual athletes, but systems-wide initiatives (e.g., at the level of the team or university) are also often important.",
