            "description": "Explores the French Revolution and the Age of Napoleon. Why did Revolution break out in one of the most powerful and traditional monarchies of Europe? What were the roots of discontent and the sources of revolutionary ideas? Probes the exciting twists and turns of revolutionary politics and the attempt to spread \"liberty  equality\" into ordinary life, even abolishing slavery in response to massive slave revolt in the French colonies. Asks how the French interacted with a transnational revolutionary movement across Europe, the US, and the Atlantic world. Though focused on a specific revolutionary era, we will also reflect on timeless questions: Why is it so difficult to create democracy? Is violence ever justified to overcome oppression and injustice? Finally, why did this experiment in radical democracy also unleash the Terror and launch Napoleon Bonaparte, the politician and general who built an astonishing European Empire? And how did he pull it off for as long as he did?",
