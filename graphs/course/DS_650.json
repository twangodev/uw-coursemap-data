Its process, culture, and value system from both design and business point of views will be covered: Empathetic understanding of the end users, problem definition rooted in systems thinking, ideation with a strong emphasis on creativity, visualization and prototyping, testing rooted in a set of research methods, and finally, the importance of iteration in bringing about innovative solutions. The path from project to market will also be explored, with an understanding of how one might balance desirability, feasibility and viability.",

Interrogate those questions by looking broadly at the place of design in everyday life, and how design intersects with society, economics, politics, the environment, and culture. Study the form, function, and philosophy of design, from what we wear on our bodies to how we move through the world. Ground discussions in close observation and analysis of previous design solutions, leading to innovative approaches to the roles, and responsibilities, of design for the future.",
