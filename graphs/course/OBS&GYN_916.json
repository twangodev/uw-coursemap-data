Increase knowledge of fundamental science concepts introduced in Human Family Tree during Phase 1 of the curriculum, such as embryology and teratology, genetic testing, and neurodevelopment. Clinical experiences will occur in a range of representative inpatient, outpatient and surgical settings. In structured educational sessions, compare and contrast selected topics in pediatric, obstetric, and gynecologic patient populations, highlighting the relevant physiology, pathophysiology, basic science, and public health topics.",
