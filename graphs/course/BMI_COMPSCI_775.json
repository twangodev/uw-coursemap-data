Encompasses theory and applications of networks, also referred to as graphs, to study complex systems such as living organisms. Surveys the current literature on computational, graph-theoretic approaches that use network algorithms for biological modeling, analysis, interpretation, and discovery. Enables hands-on experience in network biology by implementing computational projects.",
