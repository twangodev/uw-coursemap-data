            "description": "Democracy has come under stress, both at home and across the world. The global decline of democracy has accelerated over the past decade, and levels of democracy enjoyed by the average global citizen today are down to levels last found around 1990. The promise of democracy's inevitable ascent and dominance after the end of the Cold War has proven shortlived.

Examines the relationship between democracy and economic development, culture, identity, and religion. Considers and compares core democratic institutions. Investigates current challenges to democracy and democratization and offers an overview of the state of democracy across different world regions.",
