The V exercises challenge a body's uniform development, range of motion in all actions of the spine, hips and shoulders, and require significant control and balance. These exercises are great cross-training for athletes, dancers or Pilates enthusiasts who wish to feel the advanced movement potential of their own bodies. Achieving mastery over these exercises requires more practice and commitment than the Beginner-Intermediate exercises as the body is expected to move beyond its average range of strength and flexibility.",
