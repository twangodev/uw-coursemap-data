Increase knowledge of fundamental science concepts introduced in Human Family Tree during Phase 1 of the curriculum, such as embryology and teratology, genetic testing, and neurodevelopment. Clinical experiences will occur in a range of representative inpatient, outpatient and surgical settings. In structured educational sessions, compare and contrast selected topics in pediatric, obstetric, and gynecologic patient populations, highlighting the relevant physiology, pathophysiology, basic science, and public health topics.",

Topics include bases of neoplastic disorders of the hematopoietic and lymphoid systems, how underlying molecular abnormalities contribute to the pathophysiology of these diseases, and the evolving spectrum of molecular and cytogenetic/FISH testing and other ancillary testing (such as flow cytometry), which are often utilized in the work-up of hematopoietic and lymphoid malignancies. Learn about strengths and weaknesses of these technologies, and how pathologists integrate results of molecular testing with the traditional histologic exam to produce accurate diagnoses and drive clinical decision making. Develop an understanding of how knowing the underlying molecular pathology of a hematopoietic or lymphoid malignancy can inform prognosis and guide therapy.",
