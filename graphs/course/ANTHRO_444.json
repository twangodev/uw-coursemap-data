Topics include: nutrition in the context of animal foraging theory; anatomy and physiology of primate digestion; essential macronutrients, micronutrients, energy, and plant secondary compounds; field and laboratory methods used by primatologists to study primate nutrition; and how nutrition informs or intersects with primate reproduction, social behavior, disease and conservation. Discussion of the evolution of human nutrition and diet and how the study of nutrition in an evolutionary framework can inform the study of modern human health.",
