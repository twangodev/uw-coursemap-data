Focus on the active use of MATLAB for developing practical programming and data analysis skills that can be applied across a range of geoscience- relevant problems. Applications will include: data visualization and publishable figure development; automation of data processing; statistical and time-series analysis; image processing and mapping; and optimization. Additional topics may be guided by student interest.",
