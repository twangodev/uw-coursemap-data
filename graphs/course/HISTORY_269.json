            "description": "Investigates the complex history of European and American violence and war-making through the lens of race and religion. Taking a comparative approach, analyzes several major conflicts of the twentieth century, from World War I to the wars of decolonization, and from the genocide of the Herero peoples to the Armenian Genocide, the Holocaust, and beyond. Key topics include the genealogy of the modern idea of \"race\" in Europe and the U.S.; the drive towards a world of more homogeneous nation-states after World War I; and the emergence of transnational protest movements opposed to racism, imperialism, antisemitism, and Islamophobia. Drawing on a range of texts, songs, and films, investigates new connections between Europe and the United States. Take an international look at concepts like race and nation, and try to make sense of extreme violence, war-making, and the pre-requisites of peace.",
