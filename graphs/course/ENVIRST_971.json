Other new data sources are quite unconventional, with many emerging relatively recently: unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones), social media, smartphones as sources of crowd-sourced data, and more.  Sophisticated data management, analytics, and presentation technology are required to effectively leverage both the spatial (including 3D) and temporal dimensions of these often untapped data sources. Intended to survey and explore these newly developing technologies, and provide direct experience to the student to understand and interact with the data and methods (geocomputing, coding, cloud-based platforms), and to learn to plan, manage, and utilize them effectively.",
