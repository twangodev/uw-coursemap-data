            "description": "Examination of aspects of travel literature before 1800. It will pay attention to texts written by travelers of many stripes - pilgrims, missionaries, crusaders, counselors, merchants, and dreamers. It will explore how writers narrate relations between the familiar and the strange, the near and far. And it will ask students to consider the relationship of geography to conceptions of personal and collective identity. How do travel writers represent \"us\" and \"them,\" \"self\" and \"other\"? Who claims space, who characterizes it, and on what grounds?",
