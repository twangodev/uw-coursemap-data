            "description": "Membrane proteins comprise over a fourth of proteins encoded in any given genome, providing many vital functions to all cells. For example, ion channels and pumps modulate the membrane potential and help conduct information via nerves and other long distance conducting tissue. Transporters mediate the uptake and secretion of molecules. Receptors, such as G protein coupled receptors and receptor protein kinases, transfer information about the environment to the inside of the cell. Membrane proteins also contribute to the shape of the cell, the structure of the membrane and a myriad of other functions.  Structure/function relationships for this critical class of proteins are discussed, addressing questions such as \"how do membrane proteins fold?\", \"how do certain important classes of membrane proteins work?\", \"what are the challenges in studying membrane proteins\" and \"what methods are available for studying their biophysical properties?\"",
