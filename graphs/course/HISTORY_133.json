            "description": "Introductory examination of the role of war and peace in human history from the earliest forms of organized violence to the 21st century \"War on Terror.\" Rather than center on tactics, key battles, or even particular critical conflicts, instead focuses on how different military cultures and technologies emerged over time across the globe. Explores how organized violence shaped not just the lives of soldiers, but all members of society by examining key pieces of popular culture including poetry, propaganda, music, movies, and social media. Takes a deliberately global approach by examining the connections and commonalities of war across different world regions.",
