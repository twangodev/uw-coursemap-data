Topics include real numbers, linear equations and inequalities, integral and fractional exponents, polynomials and their arithmetic, polynomial equations and equations with fractional exponents, the quadratic formula and completing the square, systems of two linear equations, graphing, and problem solving using algebra and graphs. All students must pass an assessment on basic mathematical skills to complete the course. The course does not count for degree credit.",

Programming assignments require writing and developing multi-class (file) programs using interfaces, generics, and exception handling to solve challenging real world problems. Topics reviewed include reading/writing data and objects from/to files and exception handling, and command line arguments. Topics introduced: object-oriented design; class vs. object; create and define interfaces and iterators; searching and sorting; abstract data types (List,Stack,Queue,PriorityQueue(Heap),Binary Search Tree); generic interfaces (parametric polymorphism); how to design and write test methods and classes; array based vs. linked node implementations; introduction to complexity analysis; recursion.",
