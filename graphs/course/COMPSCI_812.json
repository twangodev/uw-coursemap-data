Topics include primality testing, factorization of integers and polynomials, discrete logarithms, and (optionally) elliptic curves and integer lattices.  Students are strongly encourage to have knowledge of basic abstract algebra (e.g.,MATH\u00a0541), and intermediate programming ability (e.g., COMP SCI 367 orCOMP\u00a0SCI\u00a0300).",
