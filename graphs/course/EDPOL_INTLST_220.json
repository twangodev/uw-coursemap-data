            "description": "Explores questions related to human rights and education, from the individual to the global level; from the abstract to the practical: What does it mean to be human? How do we learn to be human? What rights mark a human being? Do all human have rights? If they have a right to education, do they have a right to a particular kind of education? Can one global education and human rights model best meet the needs of our incredibly diverse global population? Can the global human rights framework improve current educational, national, social, and economic inequities? How so? How does education as a human right relate to human rights education? and who should decide the answers to these questions, and how? Investigates the tensions and boundaries of the human rights framework to reduce social inequality through methodological inquires in educational case studies, including: educational inequality; victims of the war on drugs; working children's rights; and climate change.",
