Covers the development of adaptive immune responses from vaccination, infectious processes, and organ transplantation. Covers the basic biology and pathophysiology of \"invaders\" of the human body, including viruses, fungi, and bacteria, along with their clinical diagnosis and therapy. Addresses malignant transformation of the immune effector cells themselves, including cancers of mature lymphoid cells and bone marrow derived malignancies.",
