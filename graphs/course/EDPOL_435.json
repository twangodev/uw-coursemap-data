            "description": "The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that more than 82.4 million individuals have been forcibly displaced from their homes. More than a third of them are refugees, and more than 13 million are under the age of 18. In contrast to the portrayals of children wandering among the iconic UNHCR white tents in refugee camps, new images of refugee boys and girls attending public schools raise questions about the role of humanitarianism and education across the world. What are the causes of forced migration? Who counts as a refugee today? What do camp refugees and urban refugees have in common? How do we guarantee access to school for these populations? What would a high-quality curriculum look like for these students?",
