            "description": "How did ancient Chinese create an underground space for the afterlife? Why was jade used as a medium to prolong human life or transcend the finite world? How was Buddhist art reappropriated in China? Why did calligraphy emerge as the highest artistic form of self-expression? What is the art of the silk-road? Learn about art forms and concepts that developed in China from remote antiquity to the mid-10th century.  The artworks that survive from this long period were created primarily in the contexts of funerary culture and religion, while knowledge of art made for other purposes is based on texts. Organized chronologically, examine the materials, techniques, and functions of the most important artistic media in each period. These media will include jade-carving, metalwork, sculpture, ceramics, calligraphy, painting, textile and architecture. Consider the aesthetic concepts and social groups associated with the various art forms.",
