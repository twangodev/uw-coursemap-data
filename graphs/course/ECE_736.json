Emphasis on code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems employing direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DS-SS) signaling. Topics include characterization of mobile wireless channels, demodulation of DS-SS signals, diversity techniques, interference suppression methods, and low-complexity adaptive receivers. Knowledge of probability [such asE\u00a0C\u00a0E\u00a0730] and digital communication [such asE\u00a0C\u00a0E\u00a0437] strongly encouraged.",
