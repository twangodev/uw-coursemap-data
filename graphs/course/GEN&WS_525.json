Using a feminist lens and focusing on gender as key analytic category, explores the ways that the distribution of global wealth and power impacts health and well-being around the world. Explores social, demographic, political and economic determinants of global health, and the ways that these factors interconnect with biomedicine to create and affect health outcomes, both within and across countries.
