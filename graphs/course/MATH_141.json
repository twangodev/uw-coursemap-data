Learn to reason and solve quantitative problems from a wide array of authentic contexts and everyday life situations, develop the ability to reason mathematically, and make and evaluate logical arguments supported by quantitative evidence. This course is for students who need to satisfy part A of the Quantitative Reasoning requirement and prepare for QR-B courses, but do not want to continue in the calculus sequence.",
