            "description": "Provides a foundation in reflective practices through discussion of cases, infant and family observations and mindfulness experiences as applied to students' work with infants, young children and families. Explore and experience ways in which reflective practices may be applied to parent-infant/early childhood mental health. Learn mindfulness strategies for developing self-awareness and regulation that may be brought to their work with families of infants and young children. In small Reflective Mentoring Groups, students will experience both descriptive and in-vivo examples of reflective practice through case based presentations, deeper introspection and supportive discussion to increase clarity and engagement in work with families of young children. Consider boundaries and ethical decision making related to the dilemmas faced by professionals working with families during the perinatal period and in early childhood, especially those in high risk and challenging circumstances.",
