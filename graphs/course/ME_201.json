            "description": "Provides an introduction to the field of Mechanical Engineering in the context of a major, semester-long project that is carried out in small groups as well as several, smaller hands-on projects. Obtain a shop pass, design build and test small prototypes using the shop as well as 3-D printing, take measurements using various instruments, and use a microcontroller to control a system. Introduction to software that is particularly useful to Mechanical Engineers including SolidWorks and EES. Learn how to design experiments, obtain data, use data to develop simple models of systems, exercise models for the purposes of design, and present their results professionally. It will provide a context for the math, physics and chemistry classes that are taken during the first year of the Mechanical Engineering curriculum and also provide a preview of future ME courses and should also give you a glimpse into the breadth of opportunities afforded by a mechanical engineering degree.",
