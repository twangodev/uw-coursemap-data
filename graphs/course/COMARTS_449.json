            "description": "Sound plays a crucial but understudied role in experiences of media and cultural life. From the mundane sounds of our daily routines to the irresistible refrains of our favorite songs, sound (in its various guises as noise, music, echo, vibration, etc.) is fundamental to communications media and, more broadly, to our perceptions of the world around us. An introduction to the emerging field of sound studies and an investigation into the role sound and music (or lack thereof) play in various communications media. Through audio assignments such as the creation of podcasts, learn the basics of digital audio recording and editing software and how to present and distribute audio content via the Internet, specifically as podcasts. Gain practical skills for creating digital audio projects and a deeper appreciation for how paying attention to sound leads to unique understandings of history, culture, and media technologies.",
