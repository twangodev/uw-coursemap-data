            "description": "The Cold War was the first event to impact virtually all of humanity and left a lasting legacy that still shapes the current world order. Exploration of its conduct on five continents entails both a diversity of sources (film, fiction, documents, and memoir) and a range of topics (geopolitics, ideology, internationalism, empire, revolution, counterinsurgency, and covert operations). Its half-century history was marked by nuclear-armed stalemate and ideological competition in Europe, cultural politics of repression and generational revolt in America, interplay of anti-colonial nationalism and counterinsurgency in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and a succession of major wars worldwide in Korea, Vietnam, Angola, and Afghanistan. By adopting an international perspective that carries us beyond the narrow ambit of the Moscow-Washington rivalry, integrate diverse global forces and particular national histories for a fuller understanding of an ever-changing world system.",
