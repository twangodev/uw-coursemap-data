Three interrelated themes--war, revolution, and society--allow us to place Eastern Europe within broader comparative contexts. In addition to exploring significant political, economic, and cultural changes, discover how ordinary people--including workers, peasants, women, and children--experienced attempts to change the region and its people. Throughout, discuss how East Europeans continue to wrestle with the ghosts of their past today.",
