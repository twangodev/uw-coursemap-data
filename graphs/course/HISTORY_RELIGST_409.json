            "description": "Between the late Middle Ages and the era of democratic revolutions Western Christianity saw a series of sweeping changes that altered its global profile and helped form the modern world - examines some of these shifts and their impact. Questions explored include: Why did the Reformations of the 16th century occur and with what effects on people's lives and on early modern societies? What was the relationship between European colonization, the Atlantic slave trade, new theories of race, and the spread of Christianity to the \"New World\"? How was the Christian religion resisted, received, and reshaped by Native Americans and people of African descent? What sparked movements of reform and renewal - including new Catholic religious orders and the Protestant Evangelical Awakening - and with what consequences for modern Christianity? How did the nature of Christian belief and identity change under the impact of religious conflict, political revolution, and new intellectual movements?",
