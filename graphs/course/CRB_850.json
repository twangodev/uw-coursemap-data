Increase knowledge of fundamental science concepts introduced in Human Family Tree during Phase 1 of the curriculum, such as embryology and teratology, genetic testing, and neurodevelopment. Clinical experiences will occur in a range of representative inpatient, outpatient and surgical settings. In structured educational sessions, compare and contrast selected topics in pediatric, obstetric, and gynecologic patient populations, highlighting the relevant physiology, pathophysiology, basic science, and public health topics.",

This knowledge forms the basis for novel translational research and both diagnostic and therapeutic options. Topics to be covered include the origins of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and how they are being used for both research and for clinical applications. Read, discuss, and present cutting-edge literature on how iPSCs are being used to model a variety of human diseases and how stem cell therapies are being used to treat autoimmune disorders such as Lupus Erythematosus, Multiple Sclerosis, and Crohn's disease. Participate in the Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Center weekly seminar, and hear from top UW researchers about how they are using stem cells to develop therapies for bone and vascular repair.",
