By the end of the semester the student will be able to simulate 1D, 2D and 3D structural and thermal systems, including both the static and transient response, using a common, commercially available FE software package. Analyses will be performed using both GUI and APDL. The emphasis of the course is on becoming proficient with the software and capable of operating an FE package at a high level, including benchmarking and verifying the FE model using simple analytical checks. An additional emphasis of the course is on understanding the impact of the temperature distribution in an object on the stress field through thermal expansion.",
