Architects, designers, and building engineers can work closely together to reduce depletion of critical resources, prevent environmental degradation, and create built environments that are livable, comfortable, safe, and productive. Offers the foundational knowledge on which such practice can be built on. Through a series of lectures, field measurements, and building simulations, understand how lighting, acoustics, and thermal properties behave in buildings and influence the building occupants. The proper application of building design as well as methods for designing and evaluating these features are discussed.",
