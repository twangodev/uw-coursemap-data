Participants will have the opportunity to see how theories of learning and teaching play out in real instructional settings by implementing instructional activities and then evaluating the outcomes of those activities on the basis of student artifacts. A particular emphasis will be placed on participants creating an inclusive learning environment for teaching diverse student populations. The course also provides participants with frameworks for teaching and managing their own courses, should they pursue academic positions after graduate school. This course is required for Scientific Teaching Fellows Program participants.",
