The study of international relations and international law is absolutely critical to understanding contemporary politics, both domestic and foreign. This course addresses both structural and substantive issues related to international law. In other words, it should provide basic tools for understanding the way in which international law works, as well as introduce substantive issues of interest to students of world politics. The course will place special emphasis on the role of international organizations in the international legal system, and special attention will be paid to the European Union as an international actor within this system of law.
