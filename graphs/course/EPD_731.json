Factors that influence energy demand (design, equipment, controls, operation, maintenance). Review of engineering fundamentals of heat transfer, heating and cooling loads, psychrometrics. Topics include building envelope principles (climate, orientation, materials, massing), heating and cooling systems, ventilation  indoor air quality, plumbing  water heating, lighting  daylighting, and internal energy uses (plug loads, equipment). Zero energy building concepts, energy modeling, and energy benchmarking are also covered. Applications include existing building operation and improvement, and new building design and planning.",
