Includes a lab section applied to lecture experiences to prepare for work with children in elementary after-school science clubs and to focus on different styles of communication. The multi-disciplinary focus of the after-school lessons develops connections between students' field of study and others within STEM. In the service learning component, students apply academic knowledge through science education and outreach experiences in a community-focused and culturally sensitive way. Students work with underrepresented students in the Madison metropolitan area in elementary after-school science clubs, and are expected to critically reflect on the ties between their academic and community partnerships, and differences between campus and community culture.",
