            "description": "In the twentieth century, Berlin functioned as the seat of government and as a showcase for conflicting ideologies during the Cold War, and it now faces the challenge of returning to its function as reunified Germany's capital without ignoring its past. Through it all, Berlin has maintained a reputation as a center for artistic experimentation and a mecca for alternative culture. Examine the various arts and forms of entertainment from the turn of the century through the Weimar Republic, the Third Reich, the Cold War, and the reunification, in an effort to determine how politics, economics, and demographics have come together to shape a unique Berlin culture.",
