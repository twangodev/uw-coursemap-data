Explore the definition of \"evidence-based\", learn about different kinds of evidence and how it is used, and learn strategies for judging the rigor of research evidence. Also explore the difference between an education-based approach to working with policymakers versus an advocacy-based approach, learn strategies for communicating research to policy makers (including written and oral presentations and data visualizations), research examples of successful evidence-based policymaking efforts, and understand the limits of using research in policymaking.",
