            "description": "Computational imaging includes all imaging methods that produce images as a result of computation on collected signals. Learn the tools to design new computational imaging methods to solve specific imaging problems. Provides an understanding of the physics of light propagation and measurement, and the computational tools to model it, including wave propagation, ray tracing, the radon transform, and linear algebra using matrix and integral operators and the computational tools to reconstruct an image, including linear inverse problems, neural networks, convex optimization, and filtered back-projection. Covers a variety of example computational imaging techniques and their applications including coded apertures, structured illumination, digital holography, computed tomography, imaging through scattering media, compressed sensing, and non-line-of-sight imaging.",
