Focus on medical decision-making that can be executed early in disease or injury processes, in austere environments, with a focus on acute stabilization and evacuation to appropriate medical care. Learn foundational backcountry skills such as land navigation; fire and stove operation; water and waste management; and Leave-No-Trace principles. Technical workshops and field experiences give participants the opportunity to learn from experienced kayakers and climbers from the area, to apply backcountry skills on a self-supported backpacking trip, and to continue exploring wilderness medicine through interactive sessions.",

Provide acute care in inpatient and outpatient urgent care settings as well as on the inpatient wards, and develop acute management plans and subsequent transition of care plans. Clinical experiences in acute care settings such as the emergency department and inpatient medicine (both general and subspecialty), psychiatry, and neurology. Builds upon fundamental science concepts introduced in Body in Balance and Mind and Motion, including Ohm's Law, acid-base balance, and volume regulation. Organ system-based approach employing varied modalities. Complete an integrated patient-centered experience by participating in the care of a patient from an urgent admission through inpatient treatment and discharge.",
