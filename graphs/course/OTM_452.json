While every project is unique, some concepts and tools in project management apply to a wide range of projects. The aim of this course is to equip students with these concepts and tools, and to develop them into successful project managers (and team members). With that aim in mind, the course will emphasize quantitative aspects of project management while also discussing more qualitative aspects. Key topics include Project Initiation, Scheduling, Resource Management, Monitoring, Valuation, Rework, Agile Project Management, Project Management Analytics and Contracting.",
