Learn to implement data structures (e.g., graphs) to efficiently represent datasets. Software-engineering tools such as version control and Python virtual environments will be introduced, with an emphasis on reproducibility of analysis. Tracing and A/B testing will be introduced as techniques for generating meaningful datasets. Introduces basic classification, clustering, optimization, and simulation techniques. Plotting and visual communication will be emphasized throughout the course.",
