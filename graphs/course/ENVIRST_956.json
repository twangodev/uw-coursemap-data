Topics include real numbers, linear equations and inequalities, integral and fractional exponents, polynomials and their arithmetic, polynomial equations and equations with fractional exponents, the quadratic formula and completing the square, systems of two linear equations, graphing, and problem solving using algebra and graphs. All students must pass an assessment on basic mathematical skills to complete the course. The course does not count for degree credit.",

Topics include radiation interaction with the atmosphere and the surface; radiative transfer theory; land surface characteristics including energy balance; thermal sensing; atmospheric and radiometric correction of image data; automated cloud detection and removal. Applications of remote sensing data for environmental problems will be explored in depth, including biophysical remote sensing with 3D modeling of vegetation canopies, dense time series analysis, data mining techniques, data fusion, as well as object vs. per-pixel approaches to pattern recognition. Explores all major data types, including optical, RADAR, LiDAR, and hyperspectral data, and provide instruction in hands-on image processing using open source software.",
