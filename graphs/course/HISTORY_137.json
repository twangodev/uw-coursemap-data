            "description": "Is there such a thing as a genuinely anti-war movie? The acclaimed, late French filmmaker Francois Truffaut thought not, as even the most brutal and honest depictions of war in film cannot help but valorize sacrifice and arouse something primordial in certain members of the audience. Nevertheless, some of the greatest films of all time are regarded as \"anti-war classics\" and not a few might be labeled \"pro-war.\" Critically examine more than fifteen full movies (and parts of many more) from across this spectrum and from around the world. In addition to testing the \"Truffaut Rule,\" evaluate the movies as both fictionalized secondary sources (conveying knowledge and influencing memory) and as primary sources that shed light on the moment and place in which they were created.",
