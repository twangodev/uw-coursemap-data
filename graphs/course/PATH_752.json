Wherever possible, human diseases are used to illustrate the outcome at the organismal level of defects in these mechanisms. Focuses on different cell types and how cells function. We also discuss how cells talk to themselves and each other. Topics include mechanisms of cell survival and division. Provides an overview of a broad set of cell biology topics to demonstrate the breadth and diversity of cellular functions.",

Wherever possible, human diseases are used to illustrate the outcome at the organismal level of defects in these mechanisms. Discussions focus on immunology and cancer biology. Topics include mechanisms of cell survival, cell division, signal transduction, gene expression, vesicular transport, autophagy and cell death. Explore a broad set of cell biology topics, in greater detail such that they will have a better understanding of the breadth and diversity of cellular functions by the end of the semester. Learn how to critically evaluate the literature and the rigor of research.",
