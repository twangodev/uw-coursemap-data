Topics include acute responses to exercise in normal environments and then in extreme environmental conditions (heat and cold, high altitude, and space environments). Consider exercise adaptations in athletes. Examine health consequences of low-levels of physical activity and consider the socio-cultural barriers to health promotion activities among the indigenous Maori in New Zealand, and compare them to at risk populations in United States.
