            "description": "The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) defines refugee \"as someone who has been forced to flee his or her country because of persecution, war, or violence.\" This definition represents the refugee as a victim, whose statelessness compels the need for resettlement within the nation-state. In the context of Asian America, this narrow construct of the refugee has overlapped with how Asians/Asian Americans have been racialized, gendered, and sexualized in the United States. Consider how newly arrive Asian refugee groups and their experiences have challenged their perceived victimization to challenge how the United States has positioned itself as a benevolent, humanitarian force.",
