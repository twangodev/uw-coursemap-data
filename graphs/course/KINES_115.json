            "description": "Humans are capable of achieving astonishing performances in athletics, in work and in other extraordinary situations. These extraordinary performances often provide important insights into physiological processes and their limits. This course integrates information from biology, chemistry, psychology, mechanics, etc., to understand the factors that determine and limit human performance from the molecular level all the way up to whole body movement. The emphasis in the class is on using case studies to investigate physiological processes underlying movement, exercise, and performance.",
