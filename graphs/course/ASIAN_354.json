Introduction to one of the world's great cultures through its literature during a period that many people consider to be the culmination of a millennium of cultural development prior to Japan's forced opening to the West in the second half of the nineteenth century. Covers snippets from vastly popular works in the major genres of comic books, novellas, essays, poetry, kabuki and puppet plays and so on, concentrating on the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Some key questions in this course include: What is early modernity? What is literature? What is Japanese about these materials?",
