            "description": "Stochastic programming is concerned with decision making in the presence of uncertainty, where the eventual outcome depends on a future random event. Topics include modeling uncertainty in optimization problems, risk measures, stochastic programming algorithms, approximation and sampling methods, and applications.  Students are strongly encouraged to have knowledge of linear programming (e.g.,MATH/\u200bCOMP\u00a0SCI/\u200bI\u00a0SY\u00a0E/\u200bSTAT\u00a0\u00a0525) and probability and statistics (e.g.,MATH/\u200bSTAT\u00a0\u00a0431). Knowledge of integer optimization (MATH/\u200bCOMP\u00a0SCI/\u200bI\u00a0SY\u00a0E\u00a0\u00a0728) is helpful, but not required.",
