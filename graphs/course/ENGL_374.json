Consider the origins and evolution of the African diaspora, and the many forms of its expression. Consider how the African diaspora has shaped US society today, exploring significant themes such as slavery and colonialism, race and cultural identity; intra-racial/cultural and cross-continental alliances and antagonisms; gender and genre; and the paradoxical fate so far-cultural visibility but peripheral political and economic power- of global Afro-cultures. Think about how African-American writers have been influenced by the experience of the African diaspora, and also about the ways that cultural expression from around the world has shaped US culture.",
