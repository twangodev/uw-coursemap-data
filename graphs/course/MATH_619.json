It is aimed at math majors, but will also be useful to some students in the sciences, engineering and economics who feel the need for a deeper understanding of the theory of PDEs. The emphasis is on the exposure to a number of different methods of solution of PDEs and their connection to physical phenomena modeled by the equations. The goals include both learning to solve some basic types of PDEs as well as to understand the motivation behind and inner workings of the techniques involved.",
