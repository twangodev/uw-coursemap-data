            "description": "Fundamental development of the science and engineering underlying the design of exhaust aftertreatment (catalyst) systems for automotive (internal combustion engine containing) systems. Emphasis is on gasoline and diesel, spark-ignition and compression-ignition combustion engines, though the same fundamentals may be applied to other fuels or combustion types. Introductory material is included on aspects that are related to emissions, including regulatory standards, gasoline and diesel engine basics, fuels, lubricants, combustion, instrumentation, and formation of pollutants. Several causes of emissions and pollutants are intertwined throughout the various topics and the control and treatment of specific emissions species are discussed by device type.",
