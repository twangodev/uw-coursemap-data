Increase knowledge of fundamental science concepts introduced in Human Family Tree during Phase 1 of the curriculum, such as embryology and teratology, genetic testing, and neurodevelopment. Clinical experiences will occur in a range of representative inpatient, outpatient and surgical settings. In structured educational sessions, compare and contrast selected topics in pediatric, obstetric, and gynecologic patient populations, highlighting the relevant physiology, pathophysiology, basic science, and public health topics.",

Provide acute care in inpatient and outpatient urgent care settings as well as on the inpatient wards, and develop acute management plans and subsequent transition of care plans. Clinical experiences in acute care settings such as the emergency department and inpatient medicine (both general and subspecialty), psychiatry, and neurology. Builds upon fundamental science concepts introduced in Body in Balance and Mind and Motion, including Ohm's Law, acid-base balance, and volume regulation. Organ system-based approach employing varied modalities. Complete an integrated patient-centered experience by participating in the care of a patient from an urgent admission through inpatient treatment and discharge.",
