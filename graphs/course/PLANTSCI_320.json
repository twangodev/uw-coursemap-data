Patterns are studied temporally at the daily, seasonal (yearly), and long-term (climate) time scales, geographically at the local and global scales, and contextually in natural, agricultural, and controlled environment conditions. Includes effects of environmental conditions on plant growth and development, including adaptive mechanisms to stress conditions at the physiological level.",

Topics include the historical and economic importance of plants for food, feed, and fiber; origin, classification, and geographic distribution; plant breeding; growth, development, and physiology; agroecosystems and practices; field and greenhouse production; integrated pest management; and marketing practices. Discuss and apply associated technologies (e.g. gene editing, remote sensing, unmanned aerial vehicles).",
