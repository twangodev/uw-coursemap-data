Emphasizes the importance of colonialism, commodity-based capitalism, globalization, slavery, and forced labor for the modeling of the region's social, economic, cultural, and political structures. Pay particular attention to the resilient, creative and resourceful ways in which Caribbean people have responded to these adverse conditions. Examine the circumstances that have shaped migrations from the region to the United States and Canada during the 20th and 21st centuries. Study how these diasporic communities have created social spaces in these two countries that have remained closely linked to the Caribbean through economic, political, and filial networks.",
