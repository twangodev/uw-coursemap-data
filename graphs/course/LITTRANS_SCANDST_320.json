Pippi has come to symbolize the Nordic \"autonomous\" child par excellence. Takes up a diverse selection of books and films that represent both the common ideas of the Nordic Child, as well as various elaborations of and exceptions to the idealized norm. Examines a number of the prevalent forms and themes in Nordic children's culture, such as nature, play, school, sexuality, death, loss, and storytelling.",
