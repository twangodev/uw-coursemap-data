Emphasizes the kinetics describing these processes and focuses on transformation mechanisms of organic contaminants in aquatic systems. Specific topics include partitioning between air, water, and solids; chemical kinetics; substitution, hydrolysis, and redox reactions; oxidation reactions encountered in ozone and chlorine-based disinfection systems; and photochemical and biological transformations. Knowledge of water chemistry [such asCIV\u00a0ENGR\u00a0500] required.",
