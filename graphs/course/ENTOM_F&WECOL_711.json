            "description": "Examines common methods of multivariate data analysis in ecology and environmental science. Covers methods for the analysis of complex, multidimensional datasets that are collected in the study of plant, invertebrate, fish, and bird communities. Addresses the concurrent analysis of the environmental factors that may drive community distributions. Provides the basis for predictive modeling of distributions across landscapes. General methods covered include ordination (PCA, DCA, NMDS, CCA), clustering (or classification), and other comparative analyses of data matrices (ANOSIM, Mantel tests).  Includes an applied, \"hands-on\" approach on how to use these tools, and the circumstances under which their uses are either appropriate or inappropriate.",
