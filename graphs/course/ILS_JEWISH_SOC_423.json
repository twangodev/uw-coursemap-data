            "description": "How do Jews fit into the modern world? While the \"Jewish Question\" initially referred to debates about Jewish emancipation (the struggle for equal citizenship and social integration that started with the French Revolution), it later served to describe modern Jewish political and social thought about the identity, place, and role of the Jews in the modern world. Beginning in the late 19th century, as cultural assimilation, economic impoverishment in eastern Europe, and rising antisemitism sowed doubts about the viability of emancipation and traditionalism alike, Jewish thinkers proposed new answers to the Jewish question. Learn about some of the major answers they debated, including revolutionary universalistic utopias (socialism and Communism), various forms of Jewish nationalism, hyphenated identities, cultural pluralism, and cosmopolitanism. Work to contextualize these ideas historically while also considering whether and how they remain relevant to the present.",
