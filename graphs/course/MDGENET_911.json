Provide acute care in inpatient and outpatient urgent care settings as well as on the inpatient wards, and develop acute management plans and subsequent transition of care plans. Clinical experiences in acute care settings such as the emergency department and inpatient medicine (both general and subspecialty), psychiatry, and neurology. Builds upon fundamental science concepts introduced in Body in Balance and Mind and Motion, including Ohm's Law, acid-base balance, and volume regulation. Organ system-based approach employing varied modalities. Complete an integrated patient-centered experience by participating in the care of a patient from an urgent admission through inpatient treatment and discharge.",

In modern clinical care settings, clinicians will be exposed to genetic and genomic data, including that brought by patients, and knowing how to read genetic and genomic data is increasingly necessary in clinical practice. Genetics and genomics in a clinical setting spans a wide range of topics including diagnosis and treatment of genetic diseases. Familiarity with clinical genetic analysis, and the genetic approaches used in basic science, helps medical students better understand genetic disease background. Learn how to bridge basic concepts of human genetics and clinical genetics (actual diseases). Emphases will include research into human genetic diseases, including designing genetic testing, using model organisms and/or cell culture systems, and the development of genetic testing technologies.",
