Increase knowledge of fundamental science concepts introduced in Human Family Tree during Phase 1 of the curriculum, such as embryology and teratology, genetic testing, and neurodevelopment. Clinical experiences will occur in a range of representative inpatient, outpatient and surgical settings. In structured educational sessions, compare and contrast selected topics in pediatric, obstetric, and gynecologic patient populations, highlighting the relevant physiology, pathophysiology, basic science, and public health topics.",

In modern clinical care settings, clinicians will be exposed to genetic and genomic data, including that brought by patients, and knowing how to read genetic and genomic data is increasingly necessary in clinical practice. Genetics and genomics in a clinical setting spans a wide range of topics including diagnosis and treatment of genetic diseases. Familiarity with clinical genetic analysis, and the genetic approaches used in basic science, helps medical students better understand genetic disease background. Learn how to bridge basic concepts of human genetics and clinical genetics (actual diseases). Emphases will include research into human genetic diseases, including designing genetic testing, using model organisms and/or cell culture systems, and the development of genetic testing technologies.",
