Dives into the biology, diversity, and ecology of pollinators, examining plant-pollinator interactions, co-evolution, and pollinator foraging behaviors. Examines pollinator decline and the stressors that affect pollinators, such as climate change, land-use changes, pesticides, and pathogens, as well as conservation strategies. Offers opportunities to directly observe pollinators and apply pollinator ecology.",
