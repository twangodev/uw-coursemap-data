Through examination of how different Spanish speakers deploy language in contexts such as confronting social taboos, expressing humor, being polite (or impolite), persuading particular audiences, and negotiating individual and cultural identities, students will gain a foundational understanding of several areas of linguistic study, including phonetics/ phonology, morphosyntax, pragmatics, sociolinguistics, language ideologies, and language variation and change.",
