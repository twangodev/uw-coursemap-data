Introduces how hormones and neurotransmitters shape brain and behavior in animals and humans. Review the mechanisms by which hormones shape brain sex differences and its consequences on juvenile (i.e. play) and adult behavior. Examine how hormones influence sexual behavior using basic animal models, and extend this to human sex differences, including sexual orientation. Additional topics include how hormones shape competitive and affiliative behaviors, eating disorders, and stress and mental health, as well as how individual variation occurs in response to the changing environment and genetic landscape, including epigenetics at an introductory level.",
