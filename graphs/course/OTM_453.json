Touches on all three dimensions of analytics (descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive). Emphasis on data and real industry data collected from the university, alumni, and executive board members when possible. Explore, analyze, and utilize such data in a hands-on way, using a variety of software tools. Significantly driven by a set of case problems as opposed to systematic coverage of methodologies.",

Specifically, emphasis will be on how to manage, summarize, explore, and visualize databases. The essentials of probability will be introduced and applied to decision problems where there is uncertainty. Emphasis on hypothesis testing and regression analysis and include an introduction to simulation methods. Throughout, attention will be paid to effective communication of data analysis. The use of business cases will connect the course material to both real world settings and recent advances in data analysis, including big data and data mining.",
