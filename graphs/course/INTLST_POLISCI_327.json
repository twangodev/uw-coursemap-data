            "description": "This course explores the socio-economic and political outcomes across India. This course will employ the major theories of comparative politics that explain political outcomes such as regime type, economic development and conflict. This course explores why some countries are democracies, while others are dictatorships; why some countries are poor, while others are rich; and why some countries experience high levels of violence, while others are peaceful. The course considers how India comports with standard theories in comparative politics and how standard theories might be revised in light of the Indian case. The course maps variation on the sub-national and regional level. The course will ultimately consider reforms proposed by the Indian state to further democratic and economic development and to reduce conflict. Students will learn about India's politics in a structured manner, and will gain an appreciation of the power and limitations of the political science method.",
