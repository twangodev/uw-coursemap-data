Understand how a company can connect its operational technology systems (e.g., machine tools) to its information technology systems to improve operational efficiency. Covers terminology, sensors and data, industrial computing platforms, data workflow and analysis, cyber-security, human factors, sequential logic control, and case studies of their application in smart manufacturing. Provides the basis for making informed decisions about how manufacturing processes and systems can be designed to be more adaptive (flexible) by automating, collecting the right data, sharing that data, implementing control systems and understanding the impact on humans and organizational systems.",
