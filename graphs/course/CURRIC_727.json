            "description": "Starts with a simple proposition that 19th century modern school curriculum is concerned with making kinds of people: \"the citizen\", \"a worker\", \"civic minded\", \"life-long learner\", \"motivated\", \"with grit\", etc. Discussions explore \"the building (and disseminating) of knowledge\" in schools (curriculum) across nations, cultures, and within political and religious modes of thought, to understand how differences in the self and others are produced through schooling. Internationalizing education means understanding how curriculum, pedagogy, theories of learning, and notions of childhood from schooling generate \"ways of thinking\" about \"kinds of people\". Internationalizing the field of curriculum and instruction shows how difference is produced and categorized. Facilitates thinking about how regional and national representations of people go unexamined in school curriculums when studying \"others\".",
