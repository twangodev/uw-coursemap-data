Group theoretic topics may include: permutation groups, Lagrange's theorem, Cauchy's theorem and the Sylow theorems, solvable and nilpotent groups. Ring theoretic topics may include: Artinian rings and modules, the Wedderburn theorems, the Hopkins-Levitzki theorem, the Jacobson radical and density theorem. The basic prerequisite for all advanced graduate courses in algebra.  Familiarity with topics in undergraduate algebra (e.g.MATH\u00a0541and542) is strongly recommended.",
