Program staff and trained community volunteer interview Veterans about their life stories and write up a short story based on the interview. These stories are then reviewed by the veteran and (with veteran approval) added to the VA medical record to be shared with the veteran's inpatient and primary care teams. The veteran also receives printed copies of the story for his/her family. The goal of the project is to foster a closer connection between VA providers and Veterans in their care.",
