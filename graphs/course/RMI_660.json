The skills for success in these environments include knowing how to formulate the right questions to ask, how to identify the information that is valuable for answering those questions, understanding how to process incoming information to distinguish signal from noise, and how to use that information to put structure to uncertain environments so that one can take good calculated risks.  This collective set of skills are at the heart of \"decision analysis\", which is a structured rational approach to making decisions under uncertainty.",
