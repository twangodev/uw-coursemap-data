            "description": "Focus on assessing patients with urgent medical conditions, providing acute inpatient care, and transitioning patients to other care settings or home under the care of other professionals. Provide acute care in inpatient and outpatient urgent care settings as well as on the inpatient wards, and develop acute management plans and subsequent transition of care plans. Clinical experiences in acute care settings such as the emergency department and inpatient medicine (both general and subspecialty), psychiatry, and neurology. Builds upon fundamental science concepts introduced in Body in Balance and Mind and Motion, including Ohm's Law, acid-base balance, and volume regulation. Organ system-based approach employing varied modalities. Complete an integrated patient-centered experience by participating in the care of a patient from an urgent admission through inpatient treatment and discharge.",

Basic science concepts include cerebral spinal fluid production and flow, fluids and electrolytes, consciousness, inflammation and wound healing, and cancer biology. Anatomic approach using case discussions, podcasts, curated independent reading, online nationally supported modules, and simulation skills. Longitudinal patient care experience integrating communication, evidence based medicine, health information technology, quality improvement  patient safety, professionalism, scientific inquiry, and public health.",

            "description": "Early recognition and aggressive management of shock states is one of the most challenging and rewarding patient care experiences. If done well the patient impact is incredible and lives can be saved. Integrate detailed physiologic understanding of shock states and shock evaluation - including echocardiography - with the pharmacology of shock management to develop a practical approach to patient care. Echocardiography training will emphasize obtaining views, recognizing anatomy and appreciating biventricular function as a method to differentiate shock states and select an appropriate treatment plan. The in-depth science of the course will be supplemented by clinical experiences focusing on shock evaluation and management in the cardiothoracic critical care unit, medical intensive care unit and, when possible, with cardiac anesthesiology enabling the student to develop a practical bedside approach to the evaluation and management of shock.",
