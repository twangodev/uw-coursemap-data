            "description": "A broad grounding in reproductive endocrine physiology at the graduate level, with an emphasis on human and human reproductive health wherever possible. Encompasses an overview of fundamental concepts in endocrinology, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, steroidogenesis, early embryonic development, pregnancy and maternal-fetal adaptations, and pathologies associated with endocrine disruption and dysregulation. Provides more focus on pathologic pregnancies because such pregnancies lead to a higher risk of adult onset diseases including hypertension, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Covers pregnancy and pathologic pregnancy in detail.",
