            "description": "This course examines the sources and policy implications of racial division in American politics by analyzing a range of issues, such as affirmative action in the workplace and in higher education, the use of black majority districts as a means of enhancing representation of minority interests in Congress, differences in public opinion between whites and blacks, and issues concerning multi-racial and ethnic tensions. We will examine the historical background of race relations and the current policy debates, with a focus on trying to find common-ground solutions. The goal of this seminar is to stimulate critical thinking on this important issue, causing students to think about race and politics in new ways.",
