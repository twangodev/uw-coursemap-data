Read and discuss texts representative of the major comedic modes (e.g. erudite, improvised, etc.), paying close attention to language and structure, genre debates, character typologies, performance history, and the cultural-historical contexts that informed playwrights. Aims are cultivating a deeper understanding of Italian sensibilities and cultural attitudes regarding humor and satire, love and sex, tragedy within comedy, history, gender politics, public/private space, social customs, class, and other issues.",
