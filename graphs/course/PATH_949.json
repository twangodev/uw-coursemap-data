            "description": "The genome impacts human health and disease from the moment of conception throughout growth, development, and aging. This course offers a comprehensive overview of clinical laboratory testing in the fields of medical genetics and public health. Topics include how genetic testing is integrated into patient care, including prenatal genetics, newborn screening, genetic testing in children and adults, and oncology genetics. Students will develop a strong foundational knowledge of basic genetics principles, identify indications for genetic testing, interpret population screening results and the implications for public health, assess the utility of diagnostic testing, and recognize the limitations of genetic testing and clinical laboratory medicine. It is anticipated that students will incorporate these concepts, knowledge, experiences, and evidence in their future clinical practice.",
