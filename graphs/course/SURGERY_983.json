The medical and surgical treatment of anorectal disorders will be discussed from the historical background to modern management algorithms. Topics will include fissures, perirectal abscess, fistula-in-ano, external and internal hemorrhoidal diseases, pruritus ani, fecal incontinence, rectal prolapse, obstructive defecation, sexually transmitted infections, and various anorectal manifestations of irritable bowel disease. Symptomatic presentation and natural progression of each of these disease processes will be discussed. Provide a sound scientific foundation with which to approach evidence-based diagnosis, triage, and treatment of patients with acute versus chronic anorectal disorders.",

Increase knowledge of fundamental science concepts introduced in Human Family Tree during Phase 1 of the curriculum, such as embryology and teratology, genetic testing, and neurodevelopment. Clinical experiences will occur in a range of representative inpatient, outpatient and surgical settings. In structured educational sessions, compare and contrast selected topics in pediatric, obstetric, and gynecologic patient populations, highlighting the relevant physiology, pathophysiology, basic science, and public health topics.",
