Provide acute care in inpatient and outpatient urgent care settings as well as on the inpatient wards, and develop acute management plans and subsequent transition of care plans. Clinical experiences in acute care settings such as the emergency department and inpatient medicine (both general and subspecialty), psychiatry, and neurology. Builds upon fundamental science concepts introduced in Body in Balance and Mind and Motion, including Ohm's Law, acid-base balance, and volume regulation. Organ system-based approach employing varied modalities. Complete an integrated patient-centered experience by participating in the care of a patient from an urgent admission through inpatient treatment and discharge.",

The medical and surgical treatment of anorectal disorders will be discussed from the historical background to modern management algorithms. Topics will include fissures, perirectal abscess, fistula-in-ano, external and internal hemorrhoidal diseases, pruritus ani, fecal incontinence, rectal prolapse, obstructive defecation, sexually transmitted infections, and various anorectal manifestations of irritable bowel disease. Symptomatic presentation and natural progression of each of these disease processes will be discussed. Provide a sound scientific foundation with which to approach evidence-based diagnosis, triage, and treatment of patients with acute versus chronic anorectal disorders.",
