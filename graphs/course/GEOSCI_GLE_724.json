Conceptual understanding of governing equations, and the use of finite difference techniques to solve such equations are stressed. Develop codes and become introduced to packaged models, including those developed by the U. S. Geological Survey. Knowledge of hydrogeology [such asG\u00a0L\u00a0E/\u200bGEOSCI\u00a0\u00a0627or629] required.",
