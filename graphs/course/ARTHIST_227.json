            "description": "Overview of the emergence and development of modernism in the visual arts between approximately 1880 and 1970, begining with the origins of modernist visual art in the late 19th century, then moving on to the proliferation of avant-garde movements in the first half of the 20th century before concluding with the crisis and collapse of modernism in the post-World War II period. Movements covered include Cubism, Futurism, Dadaism, Surrealism, and Abstract Expressionism. Major topics: the breakdown of traditional pre-modernist artistic styles and genres; invention of radical new techniques such as abstraction and collage; impacts of the political, social, and technological upheavals of the modern era; relations between modernist art, racialization, and colonialism; the transition between modernism and contemporary (or post-modernist) art.",
