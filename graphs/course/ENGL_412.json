            "description": "Explores the relationship between descriptive and prescriptive grammar. Examines the role of prescriptivism in linguistics from a disciplinary view (why are linguists against it when the public is so clearly interested in singling out some constructions as 'bad grammar'). Provides a historical view (the tradition of grammar writing -- who gets to decide what is 'correct') and a variationist view (corpus-based studies on phenomena like preposition stranding, split infinitives, the distinction of who/whom etc.) of grammar writing. Covers the historical and cultural roots of beliefs about what constitutes 'good' and 'bad' grammar. Introduces linguistic tools and methods to check claims about grammar.",
