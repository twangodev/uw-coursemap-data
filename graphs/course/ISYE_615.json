Gives an introduction to the basics (Kolmogorov axioms, conditional probability and independence, random variables, expectation) and discusses some classical results with proofs (DeMoivre-Laplace limit theorems, the study of simple random walk on the one dimensional lattice, applications of generating functions).",
