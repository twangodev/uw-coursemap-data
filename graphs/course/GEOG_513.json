An invitation to survey and reflect on queer critical strategies that sample, record, and remix constellations of relationships between theory, space, sexuality, gender, and identity. It foregrounds modes of queer spacing and placemaking in academic and popular works devoted to queer lives, studies, sexualities, narratives, publics and privates, joys and griefs, art, theory, and beyond. Offers a range of strategies for reading, interpreting, and developing nuanced scholarly interventions and theories. Question and reimagine normative notions of the personal, the social, and the socio-spatial.",
