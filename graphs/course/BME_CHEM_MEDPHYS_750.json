            "description": "Covers several aspects of state-of-the-art biological and biophysical imaging with an emphasis on instrumentation, beginning with an overview of geometrical optics and optical and fluorescence microscopy. The bulk of the course will focus on advanced imaging techniques including nonlinear optical processes (multi-photon excitation, second harmonic generation, and stimulated Raman processes) and emerging super-resolution methods. Special emphasis will be given to current imaging literature and experimental design. Knowledge of physics-based optics [such asPHYSICS\u00a0202] strongly recommended.",
