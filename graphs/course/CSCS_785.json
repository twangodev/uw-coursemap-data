An ecological approach to civic development - considering characteristics of persons (age, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, culture) and the opportunities, structural impediments, and challenges of social and institutional contexts for different groups. Major themes are people's collective agency in working for social change and how engaging in civic work promotes well-being. Designed to encourage a collaborative approach to learning, to articulate scholarship based on your passions for social justice, and to make your work accessible to different scholarly and public audiences.",
