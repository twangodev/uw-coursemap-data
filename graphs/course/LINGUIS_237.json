How and when did people learn English and when and why did they begin to speak only English? How has English developed in distinctive ways here? Do hands-on, original research to answer these and related questions about English and other languages past and present in Wisconsin. Examine social and historical issues and issues of linguistic structure, drawing on local histories, archival data, Census records and audio recordings, with opportunities to do fieldwork in communities across the state and the region.",
