Topics include elements of descriptive geometry, engineering drawing standards, introduction to computer modeling, and geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GDT). Lectures are reinforced by the laboratory experience where students operate modern commercial computer-aided design systems to model and to learn the basics of engineering communication, specification, and annotation.",
