            "description": "The study and use of light in the life sciences. Interactions of light with cells and tissue can be used for imaging, measurement, diagnosis, and therapy. Applications include optical imaging, endoscopy, microscopy, resolution enhancement, adaptive optics, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), quantitative phase microscopy, spectroscopy (fluorescence, elastic scattering), diffuse optical tomography, and computational modeling of light transport in tissue. Fundamental skills, concepts, and theory used for these applications include geometric optics, lens design, Fourier transforms, polarization, interference, coherence, and scattering theory. Particular emphasis will be placed on current literature and cutting edge instruments and methods.",
