Basic science concepts include cerebral spinal fluid production and flow, fluids and electrolytes, consciousness, inflammation and wound healing, and cancer biology. Anatomic approach using case discussions, podcasts, curated independent reading, online nationally supported modules, and simulation skills. Longitudinal patient care experience integrating communication, evidence based medicine, health information technology, quality improvement  patient safety, professionalism, scientific inquiry, and public health.",

Investigate the important physiologic trade-offs inherent in various strategies of mechanical ventilation. Apply these principles to patients with and without underlying pulmonary disease. Finally, evaluate a landmark study on tidal volume in ARDS, with particular attention to the scientific and ethical controversies that surround the trial. This course involves a modicum of physics and math.",

Clinical experiences in acute care settings such as the emergency department and inpatient medicine (both general and subspecialty), psychiatry, and neurology. Builds upon fundamental science concepts introduced in Body in Balance and Mind and Motion, including Ohm's Law, acid-base balance, and volume regulation. Organ system-based approach employing varied modalities.
