            "description": "Addresses the problems of representation and reasoning for large amounts of visual data, including images and videos, medical imaging data, and their associated tags or text descriptions. Introduces deep learning in the context of computer vision. Covers topics on visual recognition using deep models, such as image classification, object detection, human pose estimation, action recognition, 3D understanding, and medical image analysis. Emphasizes the design of vision and learning algorithms and models, as well as their practical implementations. Strongly recommended to have knowledge in computer vision or machine learning [such asCOMP\u00a0SCI\u00a0540] or medical image analysis [such as B M I /COMP\u00a0SCI/\u200bB\u00a0M\u00a0I\u00a0\u00a0567].",
