            "description": "An introduction to the major empirical and theoretical themes in the study of social movements and politics in Latin America. While it is impossible to cover every theoretical approach or Latin American case during the semester, the course should give students the tools to begin to think critically about where and why people engage in collective action. We will develop and hone these tools through thinking about Latin American cases, paying specific attention to revolutions, social movements, and riots. The course is designed in three parts. It begins by exposing students to the dominant theoretical paradigms in the study of contentious politics as well as some prominent critiques. The course then turns to empirical themes in Latin American revolutions, challenging students to use and question the theoretical tools to which they have already been exposed. The final part of the course looks to social movements in Latin America. Cases will focus on challenges to dictatorships, identity-based movements, and resistance to globalization.",
