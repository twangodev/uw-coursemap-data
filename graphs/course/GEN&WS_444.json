            "description": "Explores feminist theories from a broad array of disciplines and perspectives. Beginning with early feminist writings, to the significance of the Second Wave, examines consciousness raising, political pamphlets, personal manifestos, and the feminist ideology of the \"personal is political.\" Explores work from Black feminist thought, queer theory, theory from disability studies, fat studies, ecofeminism, and transnational and global feminisms. Identifies and addresses crucial areas of contestation that punctuate the dynamic relationships among texts from past and present-the arrivals, departures, and returns-in feminist theory. Listens to voices that align and voices that dissent. Engages with the work of writers and thinkers from the past and bringing these ideas to our current cultural configurations and conceptualizations of feminism(s) and feminist movement(s).",
