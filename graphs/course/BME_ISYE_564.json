This includes understanding human characteristics from the cognitive, physical, and psychosocial perspectives. Implications of these characteristics are explored through understanding the needs of people, designing to support these needs, and evaluating systems to ensure they serve the intended purpose. Case studies are used to identify the human role in accidents and to identify design improvements. Application domains include consumer product design, human-computer interaction, workplace safety, and complex systems such as healthcare delivery.",
