Focuses on the dynamics between life and environment over planet Earth's history from a microbial and molecular perspective, including the origins of life, and emergence of essential metabolisms and their evolution across billions of years of planetary evolution. Discusses how innovations such as translation machinery and carbon and nitrogen fixation were impacted by significant changes in the environment. Examines how understanding the origins of life on Earth may allow for the recognition of life elsewhere in the universe by exploring, assessing, and discussing various signs of life and the processes that expands life to planetary scale.",
