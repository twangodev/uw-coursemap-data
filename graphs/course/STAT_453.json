Since deep learning has pushed the state-of-the-art in many research and application areas, it's become indispensable for modern technology. Focuses on a understanding deep, artificial neural networks by connecting it to related concepts in statistics. Beyond covering deep learning models for predictive modeling, focus on deep generative models. Besides explanations on a mathematical and conceptual level, emphasize the practical aspects of deep learning. Open-source computing provides hands-on experience for implementing deep neural nets, working on supervised learning tasks, and applying generative models for dataset synthesis.",
