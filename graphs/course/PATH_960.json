Increase knowledge of fundamental science concepts introduced in Human Family Tree during Phase 1 of the curriculum, such as embryology and teratology, genetic testing, and neurodevelopment. Clinical experiences will occur in a range of representative inpatient, outpatient and surgical settings. In structured educational sessions, compare and contrast selected topics in pediatric, obstetric, and gynecologic patient populations, highlighting the relevant physiology, pathophysiology, basic science, and public health topics.",

            "description": "The surgeon-pathologist relationship is an integral aspect of the surgical care process. The intraoperative and postoperative findings of the pathologist confirm that the appropriate course of action was taken, and this information determines what the surgeon will tell the patient and his or her family about the disease entity, prognosis, and recommended next steps. In this basic science selective, future surgeons will have the opportunity to refresh their understanding of essential anatomy and histology, and deepen their knowledge of disease pathophysiology. They will also engage in multiple practical learning activities such as cutting a frozen section, working up a transfusion reaction, staining and interpreting an FNA cytology slide, assisting in prosecting (grossing) surgical pathology and autopsy specimens and following up on the diagnosis/molecular testing/tumor board discussion to enhance their understanding of the pathologist's critical role in managing surgical patients.",
