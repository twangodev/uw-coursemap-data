            "description": "Studies of race-related issues in education often borrow from a narrow conceptual field that can limit how the researcher forms and investigates questions. It is important for education researchers to develop a solid conceptual understanding of race, racism, and racialization, and the analytical concepts that relate to these ideas determine appropriate questions and theories to apply to the analysis of educational phenomena. Bringing together concepts related to race, racism, and racialization via core conceptual literature from philosophy, sociology, and cultural studies supports the design of education research that attends to these issues.",
