Creative problem solving in science skills will be learned through a variety of active-learning techniques that include: reading of primary literature, group presentations, peer review, bioinformatic lab exercises, science communication skills (writing  visualization), and creating a website. Emphasis will be placed upon how to effectively communicate science (written, oral and written). Topics include: genomic sequencing, phylogeny, domain analysis, transcriptomics, CRISPR screens, chemical genomics, quantitative proteomics and protein networks. Capstone course.",
