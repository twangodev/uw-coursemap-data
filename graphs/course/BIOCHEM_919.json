            "description": "Synthetic biology is a burgeoning field encompassing understanding and designing biological systems spanning from biomolecules to ecosystems. It builds on advances in molecular and cellular technologies to revolutionize biological engineering in the same way that organic synthesis transformed chemistry and integrated circuit design transformed computing. Synthetic biology has the potential to address many of society's grand challenges including: understanding human disease, sustainable biomanufacturing, medical diagnostics and therapeutics, programming mammalian cell behaviors, engineering living materials, information storage, carbon sequestration, and energy generation. Latest advances in the field will be reviewed by covering literature including but not limited to biomolecular design, sequence-structure-function relationship, regulatory and signaling networks, metabolic engineering, interactions in microbial communities, cell-based therapeutics and genome design.",
