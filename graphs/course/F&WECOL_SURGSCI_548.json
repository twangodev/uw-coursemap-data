Dissections of earthworm, freshwater mussel, squid, sea star, and rat aid the study of these general principles.",

Content will be on the biological, epidemiological, clinical, public health and, in some cases, sociopolitical ramifications of wildlife diseases. Covers a wide variety of wildlife diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites, prions, and environmental contaminants. Consequences associated with environmental changes on the manifestation of wildlife diseases will also be discussed. This range of diseases will be presented in order to familiarize the many facets involved in disease management, from animal and human health issues, to ecological and environmental considerations, to the role of society in contributing to, and managing, these diseases.",
