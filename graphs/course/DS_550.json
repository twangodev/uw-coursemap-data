How have changing understandings of child development, social and cultural history, and the history of the family shaped and been shaped by children's material worlds? Explores design and material culture topics that illuminate how histories of young children have been understood and treated and considers objects that reflect the experiences of young people, from birth through school age-clothing for babies and children, garments that mark aging and transitions, histories of homes and interior furnishings, toys and play things, objects for learning, and material objects related to caregiving.",
