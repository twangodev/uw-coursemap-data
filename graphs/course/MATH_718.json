            "description": "Random solvers have been playing increasingly crucial roles in the modern computational tasks. The recent breakthroughs in applied and computational linear algebra that incorporate techniques of randomization have proven to be of great importance in modern applied math, computational sciences and data science, such as inverse problems, machine learning and scientific computing. The guiding principle is that one may greatly reduce computational and storage expenses at the cost of a small probability of failure. Systematic study of these modern methods of randomized linear algebra solvers will be provided, presenting mathematical backgrounds, algorithms, and concrete applications. Core theoretical topics include randomized Kaczmarz and its generalization to stochastic gradient descent, randomized singular value decomposition, random sketching, matrix completion, and compressive sensing, and corresponding applications.",
