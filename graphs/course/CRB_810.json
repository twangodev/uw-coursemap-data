Emerging concepts in developmental genetics and embryonic stem (ES) cell biology are used as a means of introducing the participants to the critical importance of identifying the \"right\" question, selecting the \"best\" tools to answer the question, using the appropriate logic to interpret experimental results and finally, constructing appropriate conclusions.  Application of the literature of mouse genetics and laboratory research to biomedical health decisions. Strong emphasis on the tools used in the research literature and to 'get your hands dirty' learning the basics of the laboratory techniques involved.",
