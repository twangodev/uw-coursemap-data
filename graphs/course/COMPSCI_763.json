Three core subjects will be considered: Differential privacy and algorithmic fairness; Adversarial machine learning; and Applied cryptography, especially with applications to machine learning. In addition, a selection of more advanced topics will be covered. Possible examples include additional notions of privacy, language-based security, robust optimization. A firm grasp of probability/statistics (STAT/\u200bMATH\u00a0\u00a0431) is recommended. Previous exposure to at least one of cryptography (COMP\u00a0SCI/\u200bE\u00a0C\u00a0E/\u200bMATH\u00a0\u00a0435), security (COMP\u00a0SCI\u00a0642), and modern machine learning (COMP\u00a0SCI/\u200bE\u00a0C\u00a0E/\u200bM\u00a0E\u00a0\u00a0539or540) is also recommended.",
