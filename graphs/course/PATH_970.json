Provide acute care in inpatient and outpatient urgent care settings as well as on the inpatient wards, and develop acute management plans and subsequent transition of care plans. Clinical experiences in acute care settings such as the emergency department and inpatient medicine (both general and subspecialty), psychiatry, and neurology. Builds upon fundamental science concepts introduced in Body in Balance and Mind and Motion, including Ohm's Law, acid-base balance, and volume regulation. Organ system-based approach employing varied modalities. Complete an integrated patient-centered experience by participating in the care of a patient from an urgent admission through inpatient treatment and discharge.",

Basic knowledge of how to analyze these datasets can allow one to generate and test hypotheses that have the potential to transform a field. In this course, students will conduct individual data mining expeditions using a collection of large proteomics and metabolomics data sets. Formulate hypotheses about the interrelationships of molecules and their potential relationship to health, disease, and biological phenotypes. Basic background instruction on \"omics\" methodologies, heritability studies, and analytical methods will be provided. Provides the basic knowledge to carry out future 'omics analyses; using scientific inquiry to potentially transform the practice of medicine.",
