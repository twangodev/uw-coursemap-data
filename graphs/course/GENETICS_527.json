Can modern molecular genetics contribute to species preservation? In this course, we will first explore the challenges and potential of molecular genetic methods based on biobanking, gene editing and nuclear transfer for animal biodiversity preservation. Topics covered will include: i) maternal factors and early animal development, ii) interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer (isSCNT) and oocyte-mediated reprogramming in animal cloning, iii) developmental, phylogenetic and ecological considerations for biobanking, iv) gene editing and synthetic biology as potential tools to recapture biodiversity. Use knowledge in animal population status, developmental genetics and phylogeny to address real-life problems involving the conservation of threatened animal populations.",
