In addition to a survey of programming basics (control flow and data structures), web scraping, database queries, and tabular analysis will be introduced. Projects will emphasize analyzing real datasets in a variety of forms and visual communication using plotting tools. Similar toCOMP\u00a0SCI\u00a0220but the pedagogical style of the projects will be adapted to graduate students in fields other than computer science and data science. No previous programming experience required.",
