Topics include:  molecular and organic semiconductors; carbon nanomaterials (nanotubes, nanoribbons and graphene); advances in conventional bulk zinc-blende and wurtzite semiconductors; polycrystalline, amorphous, and disordered materials; state-of-the-art high-  low-k dielectrics; and up-and-coming and next-generation materials. Knowledge of solid state physics [such asPHYSICS\u00a0551orM\u00a0S\u00a0&\u00a0E\u00a0456] required.",
