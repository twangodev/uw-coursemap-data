Explores key aspects of Korea's great cultural and social transformation from the 15th century to the 21st century. Delves into recent studies on gender history and on the constructed notion of \"national culture.\" Also analyzes primary sources from different historical periods, as well as cinematic representations of Korea's past and present.",
