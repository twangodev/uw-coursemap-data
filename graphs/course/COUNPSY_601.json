CES encompasses the interaction known as \"service-learning\" or \"community-based learning\" (CBL) as well as complex models of academic-community engagement known as \"community-based research\" or \"participatory action research.\" Staff members from the Morgridge Center for Public Service (MCPS) will introduce the concepts and models of CES, discuss the importance of building and maintaining community relationships, identify challenges and solutions in implementing CES, and assist you in creating your own course, project, or proposal.",
