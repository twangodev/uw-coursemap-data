            "description": "Introduces optimization problems over integers, and surveys the theory behind the algorithms used in state-of-the-art methods for solving such problems. Special attention is given to the polyhedral formulations of these problems, and to their algebraic and geometric properties. Applicability of Integer Optimization is highlighted with applications in combinatorial optimization. Key topics include: formulations, relaxations, polyhedral theory, cutting planes, decomposition, enumeration.  Students are strongly encouraged to have knowledge of Linear Programming  (e.g.,MATH/\u200bCOMP\u00a0SCI/\u200bI\u00a0SY\u00a0E/\u200bSTAT\u00a0\u00a0525), including algorithms, duality and polyhedral theory.",
