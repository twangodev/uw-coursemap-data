Students will learn about buyer demographic, psychographic and purchasing decision behavior. A thorough understanding of the customer enables students to develop a coordinated marketing mix (product, price promotion and place) that will satisfy the customer better than the competition and at the required margin. Students will leave the course understanding the degree to which all company functions must be coordinated and focused on the customer.
