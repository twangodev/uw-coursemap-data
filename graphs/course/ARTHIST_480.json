Key issues include: interactions between Indigenous, diasporic, and cosmopolitan practices; the phenomenon of modernist \"primitivism\"; modernism's involvement in the revolutions of the 20th century (e.g., the Mexican Revolution; Russian Revolution; decolonization movements in Asia and Africa); nationalism, developmentalist ideologies, and state support for the arts; Blackness as a transnational paradigm; and the emergence of global contemporary art from the coalescence of various local art worlds.",
