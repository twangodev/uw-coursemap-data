Discusses how these disturbances interact, using case studies and data that highlight the role of disturbance in different ecosystems (e.g. grasslands, forests, tundra) with a focus on the ecosystem services they provide. Discusses and critiques management strategies used to mitigate biotic and abiotic disturbances, gaining critical insights from the literature as well as personal perspectives and experiences.",
