Covers structure, chemistry, and functions of macromolecules, focusing primarily on how nucleic acids carry out their central roles in cells, rather than transmission genetics. Other topics include the governing principles by which life evolved, functions, and is organized; the experimental methods used to study these processes; and the historical context for our understanding of them. In other words: soup-to-nuts of nucleic acid biology and chemistry.",
