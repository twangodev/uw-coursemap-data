            "description": "Introduction to computational methods that use stochastic algorithms and/or methods that are applied to random or stochastic mathematical problems. The main emphasis will be placed on learning practical tools, while some aspects of theoretical foundations will also be covered (e.g., basic error analysis for numerical solution of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), and basic convergence of Monte Carlo methods). Topics include Monte Carlo methods, Bayesian inference and Bayesian sampling, simulation of Markov chains, numerical analysis for SDEs, data assimilation / state estimation, stochastic optimization methods and random sketching. Applications to science, engineering, finance, data science, and other practical problems also included.",
