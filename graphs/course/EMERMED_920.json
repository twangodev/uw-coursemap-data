Provide acute care in inpatient and outpatient urgent care settings as well as on the inpatient wards, and develop acute management plans and subsequent transition of care plans. Clinical experiences in acute care settings such as the emergency department and inpatient medicine (both general and subspecialty), psychiatry, and neurology. Builds upon fundamental science concepts introduced in Body in Balance and Mind and Motion, including Ohm's Law, acid-base balance, and volume regulation. Organ system-based approach employing varied modalities. Complete an integrated patient-centered experience by participating in the care of a patient from an urgent admission through inpatient treatment and discharge.",

Students will first attain ACLS certification via AHA approved curriculum, followed by in-depth reviews of skills and underlying basic science behind the creation of ACLS guidelines. In addition to hands-on skills such as CPR, BVM respiration, I/O access, and airway management, simulation will be utilized to teach advanced skills in leadership, teamwork, and communication, which are integral to success in running ACLS-based resuscitation's. Crisis-Resource Management skills will be introduced and practiced in a variety simulated resuscitation scenarios, with students having the opportunity to practice various roles, including leading a code team.",
