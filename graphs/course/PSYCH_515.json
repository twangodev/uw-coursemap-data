Topics include investigation of similarities and differences across taxa in development, learning, memory, evolution of the brain, spatial navigation, tool-use, social behavior, parental behavior, communication, self-recognition, and theory of mind, as well as ethical issues and conservation.",

However, humans and non-human animals share many aspects of their mental lives, and, upon closer inspection, some animals even reveal cognitive abilities far beyond the capacities of humans.  Through comparing and contrasting human and non-human cognition, learn about human psychological uniqueness and its evolutionary origins, and fundamental properties of cognitive processes in general.",
