However, research shows - and our intuitions suggest - that education occurs every day in a variety of ways, with a variety of people, and in a variety of spaces. For example, education - or more specifically, teaching and learning - happens in spaces such as museums and libraries but also, perhaps, at sports practice and around the family dinner table.
