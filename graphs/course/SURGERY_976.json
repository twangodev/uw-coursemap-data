Increase knowledge of fundamental science concepts introduced in Human Family Tree during Phase 1 of the curriculum, such as embryology and teratology, genetic testing, and neurodevelopment. Clinical experiences will occur in a range of representative inpatient, outpatient and surgical settings. In structured educational sessions, compare and contrast selected topics in pediatric, obstetric, and gynecologic patient populations, highlighting the relevant physiology, pathophysiology, basic science, and public health topics.",

Lifestyle, medical, and surgical treatments of obesity and diabetes, including pharmacologic mechanisms of insulin and non-insulin diabetes therapeutics and bariatric surgery, will be highlighted. The public health perspective will shine light on societal factors that influence obesity and diabetes care.
