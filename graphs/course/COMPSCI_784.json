The first part of the course discusses topics on query languages (conjunctive queries, Datalog), their expressivity and complexity of evaluation. The second part studies advanced topics in modern data management, including data streams, massive parallelism, provenance, uncertain data management and privacy. There are no specific course prerequisites. It is strongly encouraged that the students are familiar with databases and relational algebra (COMP\u00a0SCI\u00a0564or equivalent). Knowledge of algorithms, complexity theory and probability will also be helpful.",
