In addition to learning about the strengths and limitations of different imaging studies, the student should attempt to relate abnormal radiologic findings to pathophysiology with logic and confidence. Students will be given the opportunity to rotate through the section of their choice for 2 weeks in the Radiology department and are able to tailor their reading room experiences to their interests. They will engage in hands on learning activities, interactive assignments, and learn to communicate in interdisciplinary conversations about patient care when it comes to best practices with radiology.",
