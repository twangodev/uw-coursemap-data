Three core subjects will be considered: differential privacy and algorithmic fairness; adversarial machine learning; and end-to-end trustworthy systems. A selection of more advanced topics may be covered such as additional notions of privacy, language-based security, and robust optimization. Knowledge of probability/statistics (such as MATH  431), cryptography (such as MATH  435), security (such asCOMP\u00a0SCI\u00a0642), and modern machine learning (such asM\u00a0E/\u200bCOMP\u00a0SCI/\u200bE\u00a0C\u00a0E\u00a0\u00a0539or540) is required.",
