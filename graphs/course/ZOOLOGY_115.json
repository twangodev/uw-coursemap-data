Explores contemporary threats and issues relating to freshwater ecosystems (lakes, rivers, wetlands) ranging from local to global. Covers a broad range of topics in freshwater sciences (invasive species, harmful algal blooms, overfishing, pathogens in drinking water) to provide a representative cross-section of the field. Material will tie directly to local and global societal issues. Integrates insights from biology with other disciplines (chemistry, geosciences, social sciences) to offer a deeper understanding of the threats to freshwater ecosystems, and how this affects human well-being.",
