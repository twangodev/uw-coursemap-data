Work with Native Nations and community partners to apply Earth Partnership's 10 Step process. This process includes historical, cultural, ecological, and social justice components. Learn about assets-based, culturally relevant approaches to working with community partners. Interact with guest speakers and partners to experience firsthand different perspectives on environment, cultural priorities, protocols for interaction, and opportunities for relationship building.  Work on community-based stewardship projects and reflect upon your epistemological relationship to land and people as global citizens.",
