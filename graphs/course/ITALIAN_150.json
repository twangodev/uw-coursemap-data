As Italian, American, or some undefinable other? Explore the history of Italian immigration to the United States and its effects on both the ethnic group and the hosting country, as recounted in literature and film both by those who experienced it firsthand and their descendants. Italians fleeing from racism and poverty in Italy found racial, religious, and cultural discrimination. Working toward \"whiteness,\" Italian Americans traded off their own \"Italian-ness\" while clinging to aspects of it in the hope to preserve parts of their identity. They forged strong bonds with African American, Jewish, and other marginalized communities, in a relationship of understanding but also of tension and rivalry. Focuses on specific literary texts paired with textbook readings that provide their historical and social background.",
