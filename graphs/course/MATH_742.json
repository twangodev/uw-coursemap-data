Ring theoretic topics may include: modules over PIDs, Noetherian rings and the Hilbert basis theorem, the Lasker-Noether theorem, the Krull intersection theorem, integrality and the Hilbert Nullstellensatz. Field theoretic topics may include: algebraic extensions, Galois theory, solvability of polynomials and classical constructability problems.",
