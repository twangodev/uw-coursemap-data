            "description": "Offers an in-depth examination of trans lives, selves, and ways of knowing. Focuses on the trans \"I\" as it appears in autobiography, memoir, theory, performance, visual arts, music, spacing, place making, zines, and vlogs. These works ask how styles of self-making (\"auto\") might lead to new and changing conceptions of trans lives, worlds, and social formations (\"theory\"). The trans artists and writers explored fashion selves into prisms to fracture, negotiate, meditate upon, think, and re/present the encounters, becomings, transitions, and enframings that constitute trans existence. This \"auto-theoretical\" strategy reimagines genre, style, space, and media to create launching points for new trans aesthetics, theories, joys, and struggles. The polyphonic voices of these trans selves, taken together, bring a trans \"we\" into view, creating a discursive trans space made material.",
