Current efforts to re-claim agricultural traditions and foodways to improve public health, economic opportunity, and food and seed sovereignty will be covered, including the right to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, to define one's own food and agriculture systems, and to control the mechanisms and policies that govern food distribution. Hands-on activities are featured; previous examples include cooking with indigenous foods, ice fishing, and tapping maple trees for syrup.",

Discuss some of the social, scientific and environmental challenges that conventional, sustainable and organic horticulture practices face in the production, marketing, and use of tropical crops. The field study will provide an opportunity to contextualize what was learned during \"Tropical Horticultural Systems\" (HORT/\u200bAGRONOMY\u00a0\u00a0376). Visit diverse agricultural systems, such as small farms, large-scale operations, market growers, and industrial export businesses.
