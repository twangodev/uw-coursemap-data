Examines extraordinary things (civic structures (like our State Capitol), National Parks, War Memorials) and more ordinary kinds of places (mining towns, cotton plantations, sites of recreation and leisure, and suburban tract housing) to stimulate critical thinking about how these places have served people and groups unequally and disproportionately over time and across space. Considers complex meanings of American spaces and places to different people and groups, stimulating empathy and encouraging participation in a multicultural society.",

If that question had been posed fifteen years ago, it would likely have been dismissed as unrealistic, undesirable, or just plain crazy.

Growing inequalities, financial crises, fears about jobs being automated, and the COVID-19 pandemic have all helped to put UBI on the political map. But where did the idea come from? How is it traveling to different parts of the world? And on what grounds do different advocates justify their claims? Address these questions and more by exploring the history, philosophy, and political economy of UBI from a range of perspectives. Ongoing UBI experiments from different parts of the world will also be examined.",

Topics include analysis of  current events in Australia and current resource management problems using Google Earth and other tools. Australia is a settler country, the scene of indigenous genocide, a former English colony, a mythical unknown, a biophysical puzzle, home to a startling diversity of life, a cradle of modern democracy, and a powerful industrial economy with a rich resource base. It thus serves in many ways as a mirror for the US - even matching the US roughly in size, if not in population. The two countries share many elements of a common history and biogeography and yet the human and environmental geographies of the two countries have traced very different paths into the modern world.",

The trans artists and writers explored fashion selves into prisms to fracture, negotiate, meditate upon, think, and re/present the encounters, becomings, transitions, and enframings that constitute trans existence. This \"auto-theoretical\" strategy reimagines genre, style, space, and media to create launching points for new trans aesthetics, theories, joys, and struggles. The polyphonic voices of these trans selves, taken together, bring a trans \"we\" into view, creating a discursive trans space made material.",
