            "description": "Supply chain management (SCM) is a dynamic, cross-functional discipline that encompasses the areas of strategy, product development/innovation, marketing, finance, sourcing, production, logistics, and technology in both product and service industries. The supply chain is responsible for the sustainable and efficient movement of products, services, funds, and data along the value chain. Companies must effectively coordinate these functions not only within the firm, but with business partners and customers around the world. SCM is a critical, strategic component of any business or organization, from high-tech to healthcare, and it is a fundamental knowledge base for any student of business.",
