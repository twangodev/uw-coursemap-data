Discusses how innovations such as translation machinery and carbon and nitrogen fixation were impacted by significant changes in the environment. Examines how understanding the origins of life on Earth may allow for the recognition of life elsewhere in the universe by exploring, assessing, and discussing various signs of life and the processes that expands life to planetary scale.",
