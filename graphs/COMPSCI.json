Students will work in interdisciplinary teams on projects, culminating in a final event that will be showcased to the public. While not an official uisite, the class will be technologically motivated; therefore students should be comfortable learning new software. The class will utilize publicly available game design software which provides tools and services for the creation of interactive content. While not necessary, students may find it helpful to have taken classes in programming and computer graphics (suchCOMP\u00a0SCI\u00a0559: Computer Graphics) or in 3D modeling (such asART\u00a0429: 3D Digital Studio I orDS\u00a0242: Visual Communication II).",
