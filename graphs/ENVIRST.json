Explore a number of general topics that will underpin the course as a whole: the characteristics of the Mediterranean environment, the effect of nature on humankind, and the impact of humankind on nature. Study aspects of Greek and Roman engagements with nature, such as agriculture, hunting, sacrifice, the contested relationship between the natural and the civilized, and representations of human beings using terms drawn from the natural world (\"bears\" of Artemis, cannibalistic \"wolves\"). Consider how these aspects of the ancient world relate to modern treatments of such themes. (NB: All Greek and Latin texts will be read in English translation.)",
