We will learn about the 3 main Latinx groups in the US: Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans, but will also learn about other Latinx communities. We begin with an examination of conquest by studying the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that annexed roughly half of former Mexican territory and the Spanish-American War that resulted in the possession of Puerto Rico. Then, we examine the history of Latinx immigration to understand the experiences of Mexicans, Central Americans, South Americans, and people from the Caribbean who have immigrated to the US in search of economic opportunities and political asylum. This course serves as an introduction to the varied experiences of Latinxs in the US in order to understand their unique histories.",
