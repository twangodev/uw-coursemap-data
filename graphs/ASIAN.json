In-depth studies and discussions of classic and contemporary ethnographies in multiple Asian contexts that focus on themes like religion, health, economics, and sexuality in writing, photography, and film at once illustrate various methods involved in doing ethnography and illuminate why scholars have for decades studied and represented Asia through ethnography. The methods of ethnography are never divorced from the motivations of the scholars, and thus it is crucial to probe critically and collectively what ethnography is (theory), how it is done (practice), and why is it worth doing generally and in Asian contexts in particular.",

Understanding this war is critical for helping us understand contemporary Asia. The foundations of the Cold War and the post-Cold War world that we live in today were forged on battlefields in mainland China, Burma, small islands in the Pacific, and in the skies over the archipelago of Japan. In order to provide the background and understand the legacies, this course covers an extended time frame, beginning in the 19th century with the arrival of the West in Asia and continues into the 1950s.",
