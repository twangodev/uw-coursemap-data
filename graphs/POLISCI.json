This course will employ the major theories of comparative politics that explain political outcomes such as regime type, economic development and conflict. This course explores why some countries are democracies, while others are dictatorships; why some countries are poor, while others are rich; and why some countries experience high levels of violence, while others are peaceful. The course considers how India comports with standard theories in comparative politics and how standard theories might be revised in light of the Indian case. The course maps variation on the sub-national and regional level. The course will ultimately consider reforms proposed by the Indian state to further democratic and economic development and to reduce conflict. Students will learn about India's politics in a structured manner, and will gain an appreciation of the power and limitations of the political science method.",

The principal framework is institutional analysis, or the way in which formal and informal rules shape policies and their outcomes. Students will learn to perform institutional analysis as well as write a memorandum presenting such an analysis to a policymaker. Students will align their final projects to their personal and professional activities and/or their internship. The course will help students understand how policies can achieve durable impact, and how progress made through policies can be defended amid institutional pitfalls.",

To what extent were women, foreigners, slaves, or the poor included or excluded from politics? Was Athenian democracy a robust political system or a system in crisis?",

Among other topics, we will examine the pivotal role of slavery and other forms of forced labor, the impact of the industrial revolution, the emergence and expansion of corporate capitalism and the labor unrest it provoked in the post-civil war U.S., the role of labor in the Mexican Revolution and its aftermath, the impact of the Great Depression and labor incorporation on the post-WWII social and political order of both countries, the breakdown of that order and the move to neo-liberalism in the 1970s and 1980s, and the emergence of an increasingly integrated North American production system and its consequences for labor and working people on both sides of the US-Mexico border.",

While it is impossible to cover every theoretical approach or Latin American case during the semester, the course should give students the tools to begin to think critically about where and why people engage in collective action. We will develop and hone these tools through thinking about Latin American cases, paying specific attention to revolutions, social movements, and riots. The course is designed in three parts. It begins by exposing students to the dominant theoretical paradigms in the study of contentious politics as well as some prominent critiques. The course then turns to empirical themes in Latin American revolutions, challenging students to use and question the theoretical tools to which they have already been exposed. The final part of the course looks to social movements in Latin America. Cases will focus on challenges to dictatorships, identity-based movements, and resistance to globalization.",

The study of international relations and international law is absolutely critical to understanding contemporary politics, both domestic and foreign. This course addresses both structural and substantive issues related to international law. In other words, it should provide basic tools for understanding the way in which international law works, as well as introduce substantive issues of interest to students of world politics. The course will place special emphasis on the role of international organizations in the international legal system, and special attention will be paid to the European Union as an international actor within this system of law.

Examples include governments making choices about the size of their military forces, barriers to trade, or international agreements on environmental issues. Analysts study strategic interaction using both informal and mathematical methods. Provides a good introduction to the basics of game theory -- a tool useful in many different settings -- as well as an introduction to the study of world politics. From the perspective of quantitative reasoning, one of the most important set of lessons center on the logic of strategic interaction and the notion of equilibrium. Along with basic game theory students will also be introduced to the pragmatic use of mathematical tools including algebra, set theory, functions, and probability theory.
