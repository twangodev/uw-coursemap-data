Learn how to analyze images and objects produced through such exchanges that occurred around the world from ancient times through the contemporary. Develop skills needed to live fully in a world in which borders are no barriers to the movement of images, objects, and ideas and to deepen understanding of cultural differences and interactions.

Through critical consideration of the spectacle of racialized violence and the everyday micro-aggressions of the stereotype, addresses the ways that images harm. Also considers how just representation may offer restitution and repair. Explores forms of anti-racist visual activism that seize the power to look back. And questions the ethics of an assumed right to look and to take an image. In asking these imperative ethical and political questions about what images do, trains the critical capacity to harness and intervene in the powers of imaging.",

How do conspiracy theories work? Do they fall into patterns? How can we recognize them? If they are empowering, how should we think about that? Visual material plays a special role in the reinforcement of conspiracy theories. Case studies around the world, from the Egyptian pyramids to the birth of \"modern\" art in the twentieth century, center on ways in which an evidence-based account of the making of an artwork or architectural site has been replaced by a (usually more interesting) story about its true, hidden nature. This story usually purports to reveal the \"conspiracy\" of an empowered institution or group to keep the truth away from average people.

Movements covered include Cubism, Futurism, Dadaism, Surrealism, and Abstract Expressionism. Major topics: the breakdown of traditional pre-modernist artistic styles and genres; invention of radical new techniques such as abstraction and collage; impacts of the political, social, and technological upheavals of the modern era; relations between modernist art, racialization, and colonialism; the transition between modernism and contemporary (or post-modernist) art.",

Learn about art forms and concepts that developed in China from remote antiquity to the mid-10th century.  The artworks that survive from this long period were created primarily in the contexts of funerary culture and religion, while knowledge of art made for other purposes is based on texts. Organized chronologically, examine the materials, techniques, and functions of the most important artistic media in each period. These media will include jade-carving, metalwork, sculpture, ceramics, calligraphy, painting, textile and architecture. Consider the aesthetic concepts and social groups associated with the various art forms.",

Consider this turning point in the history of Islamic culture through the lens of art and architectural patronage. Explore the architectural and urban projects of the three dynasties to examine competing visions of power, sources of legitimacy and the development of Cairo, Baghdad/Samarra and Cordoba as capital cities. Also consider the role of portable arts, addressing the role of exchange and gift-giving in the Mediterranean context and the problems of attribution in this highly mobile environment. Themes include the role of sectarian identity (Shi'ite vs Sunni); the incorporation of Christian and Jewish culture; the relation between the court and urban populations; and the meaning of ornament and style in Islamic art.",
