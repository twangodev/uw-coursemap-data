Classes are so fun if you actually participate and she really cares about her students, plus when she goes off on a tangent the stories she has are so engaging. Only bad thing is you need to go to 3 outside dances but swing club and red rock line dancing are fun to go to with friends anyway",

The class itself is cool since you get to learn about different relaxation techniques and have time to relax in class, but it's very disorganized. You don't know what reading corresponds with what week and you have to record yourself relaxing for 5-10 minutes twice which is awkward. But, it's a fun, easy one-credit class.",
