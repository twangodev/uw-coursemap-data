Prof. Allen is great and really wants students to succeed, so don't worry about grades, and don't hesitate to ask questions!",

Her grading is super fair, as long as you do what is expected. Homework includes some reading, discussion posts, 3 tests, 3 papers, and two 2-3min speeches (presented to small groups). Great class!",

I loved how often we did small group and partner discussions, and the essays/debates/tests were given very clear instructions and expectations.",

In fact, I can't even remember textbooks for the class. You have to write a few papers - no final. She's a very fair grader, and it's easy to get an A with a regular amount of effort. Great class.
