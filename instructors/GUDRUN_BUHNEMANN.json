One midterm &quot;paper proposal&quot; and a final paper and presentation. Can feel a bit repetitive, but she is very sweet and if you clearly try, you should do just fine. Don't wait to start the final paper!",

Her slides were just a black screen with very few words thrown together. It was hard to understand her and she seemed to just be throwing out facts for us to memorize nonstop. The class was pretty easy though.",
