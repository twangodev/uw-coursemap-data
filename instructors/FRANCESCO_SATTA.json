There wasn't a specific day when verificas (quizzes) were gonna be taken, but you learn to anticipate when they were coming. You'll catch on pretty quickly, don't be intimidated by his style of teaching.",

He is a native Italian speaker, so there was certain material that was not taught in the most accessible way, but Francesco is super open to questions and truly wants everyone to do their best - just go to him if you have any questions.",
