A lot of busy work, like homework every night. The readings can be long, but there are these poems that literally make no sense but he convinces you they hold a lot of weight. Also,Interesting how an opinion can be wrong...",

I sincerely hope for the sake of future students that he isn't allowed to teach again. ",
