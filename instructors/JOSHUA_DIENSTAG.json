In-class essays ain't half bad, but the readings can be arduous, especially some of the classics, i.e., Plato and Socrates. Time-consuming class and content can be a bit of a bore, your TA can really help make the class more engaging.",

If you go to all the lectures and discussion secs. there is no reason not to do well in the class. Be warned, if you are bad at writing essays this class is not for you. ",

It is a really complex class. \n\nIt was challenging he was really good at teaching it, but you're not going to do well if you don't do the work. \n\nTHIS IS NOT AN EASY A!
