Just use what she says and you're golden.",

I took LT233 and her grading was very lenient, with easy topics and rubrics for the tests that let you basically prep everything.. 234 was similar, but the essay grades were WAY harsher for no reason I could tell. She has very precise ideas of what you should be writing about; basically you need to retell her lectures in detail.",
