Her lectures are very clear and organized, has very popular office hours each week for homework and quiz help, which can be really tricky but overall doable, and no Friday class. Go to exam reviews!",

Would recommend going to all optional exam reviews and office hours as it is extremely helpful for the exams! If you do the homework, and make good notecards for exams an A is definitely doable in this class!",
