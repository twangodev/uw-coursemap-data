The class policy memos kind of stink and it's hard to understand what he wants until you get the hang of him. Very open to questions. participation grade is easy as long as you show up.",

He teaches you how to write a memo and how to do it well. Final exam was a joke 55 questions and 25 multiple choice - did not have enough time, no one did. Lectures get boring sometimes.",
