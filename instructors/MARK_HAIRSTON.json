He is dismissive of others ideas and stinks of a superiority complex. Picks and chooses what information is viable when giving a justification. Impossible to get a correct answer. Lots of reading. Also walks barefoot in class.",

Mark does not put any grades in until the semester ends, so you will not know how you are doing in the class. Class is MANDATORY if you miss more than (I think) 4 your grade drops a letter. Overall easy A but not fun.",
