Exams aren't difficult if you look at the practice exams and go over lecture materials. Two exams and that's it - no other hw besides reading. Highly recommended for a low-work Hist Sci course.",

A full mix of real medicine (prof's background in medicine a real plus) with expertise in the Greek and Latin sources, a vivid evocation of ancient medicine from prehistoric time to about AD 200. Galen a highlight. Perhaps too much reading assigned, but what I did was relevant. Prof's humor low-key, subtle, appropriate.",

Careful integration of early Muslim medicine with Byzantine texts, good on Kievan medicine, rather fascinating stuff of the Crusades and military medicine.

If you want to do well, print off his lecture notes and come to class and take good notes.  Unless you are extremely interested in the topics, don't spend the $400 on the textbooks, they were not needed.",
