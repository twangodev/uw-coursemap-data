He expects a lot out of his students. Do what you are supposed to? You get a B. A's are for above and beyond. It's a fun class. I actually really appreciated his tough critique. Helped me later on :) ",

Unless you are willing to drop everything else in you life and focus on 370 you probably won't get an A. This course is hard especially because they dont explain how to use the programs to their fullest ability.",

If you do exactly what you are supposed to do, you get a B. All A's are \"above & beyond\".. Except you don't know what he expects from you. Quizzes are every week & he is the harshest grader I've ever had.. Good luck.",
