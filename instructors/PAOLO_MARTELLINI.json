Class averages on the 3 tests only cracked 60% once (at 60.4), which led to a very generous curve at the end (75 for an A). This was likely due to a few factors, mainly boring lectures and bad study materials.",

The way the class is structured can be frustrating because you're only graded on 3 midterms and 4 problem sets, but the lowest midterm and problem set is dropped.
