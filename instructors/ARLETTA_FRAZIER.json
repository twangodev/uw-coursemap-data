Thought the class is easy, her curriculum and class structure has grown a little shaky over the past couple weeks. She's awesome, but I've seen less and less people paying attention. She tells a ton of stories.",

Furthermore, there was no textbook required or final exam, just essays, which were very manageable. I would highly recommend this class &amp; professor",
