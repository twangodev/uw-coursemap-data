Her grading for exams was inconstant in my opinion and she was a tough grader on random assignments for seemingly no reason. Overall, she was very kind but has some room to improve as a professor. The class was very interesting in my opinion.",

Be warned that she is not an easy grader. Explain yourself and be specific. With that being said, she does award partial credit. The passion from this professor is unmatched, loved!!",
