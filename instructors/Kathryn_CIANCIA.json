If you want to love history, take her class. She's a gem.",

Do the readings, show her in papers that you understand and have been paying attention and you'll do well.

None of the work is too stressful. Readings aren't great but lectures cover interesting material. She involves the class during lecture, which I think is effective for smaller classes.",

Pre-20th century Poland mostly glanced over. Some eye-opening parts, but frankly not a very challenging class. Breezed through most of it. Feel like there are better European history classes at UW.",
