The only thing is that I don't feel like the CBL was integrated well into the class. You're only required to do one discussion post a week and there's only a few quizzes that are pretty easy. I never read the textbook and was fine. ",

She won't record class if you're ill or offer virtual options, even though her class is on accessibility for those with disabilities. The CBL component is poorly integrated with the course as a whole, but it is the only redeeming factor here.",
