She doesn't really seem to know what she's talking about because she is constantly contradicting herself and sometimes says things that are flat out untrue. Pretty frustrating to sit through her lectures.",

This class used to be taught with 20-30 people (the people giving her good ratings), but she is now teaching it to 150+ students. She has NO idea how to adjust to this change, and should not be teaching this way",
