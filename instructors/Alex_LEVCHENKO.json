If you dont have math chops good luck as the class is 90% analysis. He isnt willing to change this aspect of his cour Plays around with the sound modest models he can in lecture then slams you with insane homework. Id probably avoid",

You will learn a lot if you do it though. Just a comment about 311 with Levchenko, it's more of a class in physics, not just mechanics. I'm taking him for 415 next semester. Take him if you are serious about theory.",
