The assigned readings are always under 10 pages and very engaging. He is very clear with communication on assignments, and understanding when mistakes happen. Great ethnic studies course",

Be sure to do the assigned readings since some MC questions on exams are tricky without them. Beware, Pedriana occasionally contradicts himself, so be prepared to make note adjustments. Overall, a nice easy A for ethnic studies.",

Overall, the work isn't bad: there's three 2-3 page essays, weekly reading reactions, a research paper, and two exams. The exams pull questions straight from the lectures (and occasionally a reading or two). Easy A.",

I would definitely recommend if you need a comm B or a soc class credit!",
