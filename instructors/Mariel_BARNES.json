No tests, no homework; there are only assigned readings that are discussed in class. She tends to grade VERY easily. This is a super chill class that you can expect an A or AB from with minimal effort.",

Make sure to put 100% into assignments though as there aren't many of them. A bad grade on one project could really hurt. I'd absolutely take her class again. Be sure you actually do the readings before class. Time well spent!",
