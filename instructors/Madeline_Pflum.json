She reads off her slides, barely teaches anything, and almost all of the information is from the textbook. You are essentially teaching yourself the entire content of the class through the textbook. Succeeding in this class is virtually impossible.",

She doesn't curve tests or final grades, although the class average accurately reflects her teaching abilities. Be prepared to essentially just teach yourself the entire course if you want any chance of passing.",

The prof reads from the slides during her lectures, and the book is mostly fluff that does not relate to test material. The average on the first test was a 58% (F) and still was not curved, when, in my opinion, that is a reflection of her teaching abilities.",

The lectures put you to sleep, the grade distribution is worse than both gen chems', and the exam questions are (imo) poorly written and are often up for interpretation. However, since it's all multiple choice, you can't explain the answer. The prof. is nice, but the course itself is ironically mind-numbing.",
