All the graded assignment are group work and the whole group will receive the same grade even if you did better for your part. So you got to make sure your randomly assigned group members are responsible. Also, she did't provide an encouraging environment for students to participate.",

There's a lot of working in groups and definitely make sure to participate. Her classes are usually super small and in an intimate setting, so it's definitely easy to participate. There's no exams and only three writing assignments.",
