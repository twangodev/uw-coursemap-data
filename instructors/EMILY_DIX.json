She was fine overall, but wouldn't input grades or provide feedback midway through the semester. She was late to her own deadlines when she promised grades by. It felt hypocritical given her hard late policy. Wouldn't recommend for a 601 course.",

Uses the first half of every lecture to talk about what she is going to talk about that day, then only talks about one study that you hardly see again.

However the tests are not doable if you don't read EVERY word in the text book to supplement her rambling about 1 study for a whole class that there will be 1 question on the exam about.
