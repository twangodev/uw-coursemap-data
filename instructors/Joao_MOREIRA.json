Make sure to be on top of your Canvas quizzes bc those can make or break ur grade. I'd recommend going to office hours to ask any clarifying ?s for exams/essays. If you have a specific situation or hardship in the class def talk to him in person.",

The vibe during lecture definitely became less sterile and more personable as the semester progressed, so I would expect more of the latter going forward. \n\nTake a shot for every film reference during lecture :,)",
