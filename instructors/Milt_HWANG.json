There were no exams, but quizzes that were harder than you would think. His lectures felt long at times and could get off track, but he is passionate about marketing.",

While Milt does have a 30 minute recording posted every week that connects the topic to a  case study, I feel like he should be more involved in the course. Almost all learning happens over the Cengage textbook, and as a result, the content did not stick with me as well as it should have.",
