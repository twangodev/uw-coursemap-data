He cares a lot about his students' understanding of the course topics, and teaches at a pace that allows for a full, deep understanding of the material. He can go on about a topic when you ask him a question and get sidetracked, but it's only because he really wants you to understand. Love him.",

Some people don't like how detailed he is in lecture, but I did because he relates to the real world and is passionate about it. Only two tests so make them count. Only 6 HWs but they take awhile; can't do them in just one night. If you go in to his office hours, he will talk your ear off. Great prof.",
