The material is dry but John's quirkiness is hilarious. I would not recommend the textbook since his two quizzes are only from the slides (very easy). Additionally, I would suggest doing his extra credit oppurtunities!",

Although the class should have moved faster (it was really a 2credit workload) the readings were interesting and Surdyk was fun to listen and talk to.  Your grades will mostly be participation and group projects, and as long as you work at it you should get an A. The LEC also usually starts late and ends early",
