You really do learn a lot from her but its not stressful at all since she allows corrections for half credit on all quizzes. She just wants you to learn the stuff rather than stress you out over exam grades. Super laid-back. ",

Exam was pretty easy though, ecology subject material is very very easy.  Also find someone who has taken her last semester/year.  The questions on her exam barely change from year to year.

I can't walk down the street w/o trying to ID every single one, and you learn cool facts about them all! Sara is a wonderful professor, a very sweet lady, and extremely approachable.",
