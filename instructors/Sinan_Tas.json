Homework wasn't bad, and the group project didn't take too long. All grading was fair and tests were similar to the practice material. The textbook wasn't worth it, but other than that all was good.",

Took a very long time to get grades back and feedback was often questionable, though that is at least in part the TA's fault. Not the most organized.",
