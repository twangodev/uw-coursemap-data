Multiple readings a week, 5 exams throughout the semester, and a semester-long group project in discussion section that is separate from lecture. \n\nDoug is such a fabulous professor; I wanted to go to all of his lectures!",

There were 5 exams, several papers and also a group project. Also beware if you take this class online that the lectures are very long. Good class overall, but be prepared to but in a decent amount of effort.",

The TA gets a bit confusing with deadlines and assignments. The class is 5 exams and theyre kinda hard. No extra credit this semester but I think he will give us a bit of a curve.",

He is really funny, casual and relatable. He gives fantastic feedback and is so encouraging to everybody in class regardless of skill level. He keeps it real and I'd definitely recommend him!",

My only criticism is that his lectures are a bit unorganized: there seemed to be one long lecture for the entire semester with no clear-cut stopping points for each class period. I would recommend the course, but know that readings are essential!",

Tests are a bit tougher than other journalism classes and only have about 30 questions, so not much room for error. You can make up for it by doing the extra credit though.",
