She has so many examples from the field, and is clearly passionate about the subject. She really cares about engaging students. All of the readings for the class are online. She tests on reading material, but a lot of it seems to be covered in her lectures.",

Professor clearly knowledgeable of certain aspects of course materials, but lectures sometimes had outdated information/problematic materials.  Professor was very dismissive of student concerns.
