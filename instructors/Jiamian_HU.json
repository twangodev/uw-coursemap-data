I just find his teaching style mediocre at best and found myself learning 90% of the material outside of lecture. To be fair, his lecture notes are very good. Youll have the resources at your disposal, youll just be learning it on your own.",

He has by far the best supplemental material for a class I have seen, his lecture notes are immaculate. Dont get scared by the number of derivations, you are not required to learn them.",

First, he teaches you from his mentors unpublished textbook that has mistakes in it and it is not very helpful with learning the content. If you get a good grade in this class you're simply lucky.
