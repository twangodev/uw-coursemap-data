He does call on people a lot, but he won't call on you if you ask him not to. There are a lot of small homeworks, but they are very easy. He can be a little scary, but he's really nice :)",

He tries to include TV, music, movies, and culture into the lectures so it's not just straight grammar and reading. There is a lot of repetition, but that's necessary for language learning. He's always super helpful and will answer any questions.",
