If you care about actually walking away from a class feeling like you learned something, take a different class on the EU. I could've learned more from a Wikipedia page than Melody's lectures. ",

This class is primarily about migration especially in the second half of the semester and not as much about culture. I would not recommend this class.",

She doesn't teach to test, she teaches to engage which makes classes outstanding! Can't recommend her enough. 1 research paper, daily discussions and two in class essays. Keep up with the reading - you get WAY less out of the class if don't.",
