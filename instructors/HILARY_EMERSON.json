She's also fantastic at making sure everyone understands the hefty amount of challenging material that she has to get through, and stresses constantly that she's available for office hours if needed.",

Participation does matter more than in most other classes and she speaks mostly in Italian.  Very passionate about the language and teaching it.  Honestly just a wonderful person.",

She expects you to stay on task. But all in all she was very nice, helpful, and knowledgeable. She made important deadlines clear and always gave tips on the most important things to study.",
