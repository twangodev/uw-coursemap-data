The entire course is basically a giant tangent about whatever interests him and he'll loosely tie it back to consumer behavior. I honestly felt like I learned nothing after every lecture. His tests were also very detail-specific rather than big picture focused :/",

Prof Thompson talks a lot about different scientific models and supplements them with real-world examples. Very interesting lectures! Tests are not that hard but you need to study.

He is informed, interesting, enthusiastic, and makes the class fun and really entertaining. The material is so thought provoking that studying is really easy. Take his class. What you learn is applicable in the real world and the class is fantastic.",

He's one of the most impatient people I've ever met, but its kind of funny. The class required little work because your grade was based on 3 exams, that's it. I'd say the exams were medium difficulty.",

Class doesn't involve tons of work, and consists of 3 exams. Fun class",
