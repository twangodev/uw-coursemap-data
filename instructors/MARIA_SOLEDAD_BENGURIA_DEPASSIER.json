She always asks for feedback during lectures in terms of questions and on in-class practice problems.  The exams challenge you a little bit but strongly reflect the course material so if you study and keep up with the hw and worksheets, you'll do fine!",

Though there are modules and weekly quiz, you can try for UNLIMITED time and UNLIMITED number, and only the HIGHEST counted. She also dropped 2 of the lowest. I mean how can you be nicer than that?",

I didn't go to lecture very often and still did well in the class. Pay attention to discussion materials/quizzes & practice tests. The final was a lot like the practice final in fact slightly easier",

Patient and accessible after class. She doesn't use textbook at all. The only thing making me feel not good is she sometimes makes mistakes. But generally I would recommend her.",
