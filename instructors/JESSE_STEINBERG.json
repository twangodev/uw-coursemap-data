He takes paper drafts, so take advantage of that. Make sure your arguments are fleshed out rly well in the papers because he is not a particularly lenient grader. The subject can be duller than you expect.",

Straightforward exams, several writing assignments - not bad for upper level course. Jesse is my fave!",
