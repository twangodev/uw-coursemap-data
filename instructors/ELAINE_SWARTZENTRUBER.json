Homework is very manageable if you study smart. One exam (open notes), one final project. Sometimes she took a long time to grade. Ultimately I walked away a much more curious person!",

She is strong &amp; whip smart! :) Highly recommended! :)",

As long as you complete the assignments you'll do well in this class. She is intelligent and knows a lot about Islam (lived in Indonesia). The material was refreshing and different from other GWS courses. Would recommend.",

Super open-minded, wants everyone to grow and succeed! If I wasn't graduating, I'd take her again-no matter the class! No exams, portfolio project of your own topic & design due for a final. Down-to-earth, wonderful woman.",
