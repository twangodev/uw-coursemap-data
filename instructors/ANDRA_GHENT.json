She was also the first one out of the room following lecture, something no other professor does. She is terribly unprepared for lecture, often taking multiple attempts to solve an example problem in front of class.",

Class gets a lot harder as semester goes on, but if you study the quizzes and understand the process of each question (thats the key) you'll be fine. Fairly generous curve.",
