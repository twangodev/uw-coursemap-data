There is a book you need to read but the subject matter is pretty interesting and you only need to read the relevant bits. A lot of the grade was also writing discussion posts but there are many opportunities",

I disliked exams because we had to regurgitate info we would probably forget, like a random fact about an insect in lecture. Aside from that, Cooper knows what he's doing and is really smart and passionate",

I didn't bother going to class 80% of the time, but when I did, Professor Rosin showed exemplary passion and knowledge for what he was teaching. If you want 100%, read the textbooks as well. Lots of extra credit involved!",
