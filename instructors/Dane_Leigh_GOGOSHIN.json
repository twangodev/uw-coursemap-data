She's super knowledgeable, eloquent, and flexible--no penalties for tech issues, and she graciously moved due dates because of other midterms. If you actively participate, you're super likely to get extra grade-boosting opportunities--it is hard to run a huge class like a seminar. Kind, fun to talk to!",

She's manageable for a required class but not great",

This class was literally the easiest A I've had in a long while. Yes lectures were a little dry, but Dane is a kind person. I think she was just hoping for a more seminar-ish class format? But very difficult to do w such a large class.",
