She explains things easily, so if you pay attention in lectures, you won't have to learn from the textbook. When I took her, we used a terrible textbook called codio that was probably written by AI.

Lectures do feel tedious however, but are not required. There are weekly online quizzes and 2/4 unit tests are take home. Overall, Blerina is very kind and easy to understand.",
