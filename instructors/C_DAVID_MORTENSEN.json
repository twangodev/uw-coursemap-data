To many personal details and don't talk to him or he'll use you for his research. Untrustworthy",

He's notorious for random tangents, chalkboards filled end-to-end with randomly placed arrows and meaningless notations, and readings that will either confuse or bore you to tears.  His books are dense, dry, and overly wordy.   90% of what he covers in class isn't on the exams.  Avoid like the plague!!!!",
