She writes pretty small and messily on a whiteboard for notes and she will say &quot;any questions?&quot; without looking around for questions and then moving on even if hands are raised. She also does not respond to emails even if you follow the guidelines she puts in the syllabus. Not my favorite professor",

The class overall is a lot of work, but the group project is fun and the homework is helpful for understanding material. The exams are fair. She's very helpful if you need to meet outside of class, and you can tell she cares",
