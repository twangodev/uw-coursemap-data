He made sure to give us feedback on our responses and gave us a lot of good tips on how to write good essays. He has a very good knowledge of African literature and he shared many experiences from his own culture and other African cultures. It's a good com b class.",

He is funny at times, but explanations and expectations are not always clear until you get points off on a test or homework. It seems like he forgets that this is only an intro. level class and that making us not want to take arabic again isn't the goal.",
