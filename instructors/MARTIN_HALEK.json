He made Insurrance fun and inresting, and I would reccomend anybody interested take his class.",

Yet, amazingly, his lectures are simply a combination of material learned in other entry level classes and basic common sense concepts.  I  believe this entire class could be taught in a single 2 hour lecture.  So, take this course if you want to learn next to nothing.",
