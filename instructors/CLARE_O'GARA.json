They helped us understand all the different assignments, which the schedule for the main lecture was kind of confusing. There are a lot of papers we have to write and while peer review makes sense in theory my classmates weren't really helpful. Clare is really funny too!",

The midterm and final are hard so definitely read the textbooks (which are expensive btw). Overall if you are interested in public speaking I'd definitely take this class with Clare!",
