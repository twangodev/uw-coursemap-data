There are no tests or quizzes and each week you have 2-3 short writing assignments and 1 actual art project. Not a ton of work, especially if you space it out over the week. Definitely recommend this class!",

Easy 3 credits if you're taking pretty intensive courses in person.",

He has a lot of experience in art and offers a lot of different opportunities to expand your artistic skills in Drawing 212. He even brings in his own technologies for his students to explore. He gives good feedback and is very funny, but sarcastic at times. 100% recommend taking his class.",

He will push you out of your comfort zone a bit but it honestly always pays off. He really casual but does expect you to put in the work. He's really understanding about personal situations.
