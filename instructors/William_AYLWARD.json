His powerpoints/slides are  not at all detailed; however, he's quite articulate. Read the book or at the very least the vocabulary list after class. It elucidates material before heading to his office hours.",

It's a pretty easy class; lecture's aren't really necessary as he pretty much lectures out of the book.  That being said, his lectures are funny and engaging.  Great professor",
