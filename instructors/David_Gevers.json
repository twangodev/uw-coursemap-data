Cannot ask for a better intro teacher and he puts out his expectations very clear and easy to reach. Assignments are graded more on effort and that aslong as you try you cannot get below an A in the course. ",

The grade you receive is based on a few very short papers and two exams. The exams were extremely easy, and the papers didn't require much more than an hour to get a 100% on. I highly recommend his class.  ",

The class is not difficult, but you will have to study for some of the exams, as they are a lot about recall and memorization. I recommend this class if you want to learn about the basics of real estate.",
