The class requires you to come in with an open mind since the topics can be controversial, but the assignments are not hard. She is lenient about extensions and absences as well. Highly recommend!",

There was a lot of work for the class (readings, papers, and daily self-evals during each lecture) but if you put good effort into your work, you would get graded fairly/nicely. Ms. Bell is a great teacher and I would definitely recommend her class if you can handle the workload.",
