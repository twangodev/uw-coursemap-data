He encourages group participation in a way that is welcoming with no pressure at all. The content was new to me, but he always took time to make sure each student understood the course individually. Take his class if you can!",

Amazing class - it's structured as more discussion heavy so I feel like I gained more out of it than just a typical lecture that drones on and on. The assignments aren't difficult as long as you try to participate and put in some effort. I would LOVE to take him again. Take this class!!",
