Four (rather difficult) homework assignments on excel during the semester. 4 Unit exams are online, unlimited time, open book, open note. Very conceptual but thats okay because everything is gone over well in lecture and in his slides. Final exam is reasonable. ",

His combination of humor and research make every class period intriguing.
