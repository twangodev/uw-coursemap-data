Didn't show up for the first month of school, then showed up and didn't give a warm introduction. came in and started bossing people around right away. Good intensions, just not the most fun person. Very easy class but not very entertaining. ",

Most of the time, you didn't even need to read the texts, but occasionally she would spring in-class assignments that were essentially just quizzes about the assigned readings. These were few and far between, however. Overall, a great professor. Also, there are no exams, just papers.",
