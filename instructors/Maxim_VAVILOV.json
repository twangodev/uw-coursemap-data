His lectures were pretty average; mostly a bunch of equations, sometimes it was hard to follow exactly WHY he was doing what he was doing. Overall 3.5/5. ",

We didn't have a final exam for 311- instead we had a project that was very easy if one showed up to class. The homeworks were bi-weekly, so one had plenty of time to do them. Overall, not a hard class to get a decent grade in if one practices a few of the problems.",

However his grading scale makes it easy to get an A or a B if you do the work and study.  Exams are completely fair, study for them and you'll do fine. His accent is not the easiest to understand at first but you get used to it quickly.",
