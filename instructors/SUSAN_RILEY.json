You're also expected to memorize A LOT for the tests, but tests don't necessarily consist of all the material on the study guide. She's very nice though, and is always open to answer questions.",

She tests you on some things that she doesn't teach (SO READ THE BOOK). Tests? Not bad if you study. She is super nice. DON'T expect grades back anytime soon. Very slow grader.",
