She always makes jokes or does funny dances to pep us up when we're not talkative. And now about her teaching - incredible. She is full of love and passion. Rare to find nowadays; take it, you won't regret it.",

She is always there for students and challenges us to have deep discussions in class. If you do not want to think, do not take her class. If you don't mind talking a bit to your peers take this, the grading is fair, and the lectures are interesting.",

In light of recent racial incidence we stand in support as she gave us the tools and knowledge to tackle these problems head on. The class is engaging and empowering as Prof. Almiron leads by example. By far the most impactful class that I have taken at UW.",
