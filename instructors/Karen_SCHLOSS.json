There are no resources to help prepare for exams except for watching back the lectures and reading the textbook. No previous exams/examples given, not curved, very tough.

To study for the exams, just go to the online textbook website and memorize the flashcards and you should be fine. She gives out free points for attending lecture. Cool class if you're fine teaching yourself",
