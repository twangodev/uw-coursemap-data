Just read the book before lecture and do the homework assignments on a weekly basis and you'll pass with an A-B.

The fact that I sat through lectures three times a week was hilarious, as I didn't learn a thing in the four months of classes. The lectures amazed me as they were regurgitated PPT slides",
