He will not cover everything and instead go deep into topics that are irrelevant but still you are required to be there. We are urged from the start (correctly so) to use textbook as word and his lecture as supplement, which is accurate",

He barely uses the board or PowerPoint so he literally just rants the entire class with little order. Explanations are convoluted and given too fast. The class overall lacks engagement and he blames it on iPhones and the digital age",

Thermo is hard enough, but his lack of structure to lectures confuses things more. Also homework is only 10 points a week and graded harshly. Make sure to ask TA's questions during discussion because that helps clarify things a lot!",

But the problem is the lack of material to study from to build these basics. Be prepared for averages around 40 for each exam. Also, unhelpful through piazza and inaccessible. You will be purely on your own for this class. He made me hate my major.",
