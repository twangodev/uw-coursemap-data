While it is true he sometimes talks a bit fast, he will answer any questions both inside and outside of class. I would take him in any Poli Sci class.

Grade is based on just 3 exams, but they are take home, and the criteria is pretty clear. He also offers an extra credit assignment that can add up to 3% to your final grade. Highly recommend to anyone with a passion for law.",
