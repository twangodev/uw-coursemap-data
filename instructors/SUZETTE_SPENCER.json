She is harsh and strict and to the point and I don't think that a lot of students are used to that. She was fired by UW because they said she wasn't &quot;accredited&quot;. I loved the class though.",

If you don't agree with her about an idea or concept, she'll shut you down in front of the class. It made me want to stop talking in class. Course is good, just stay away from her.",

She just talks about whatever she is feeling, usually that we (the students) should be doing better in the class.  She is VERY intimidating and you will not want to go to class, but it is mandatory.  AVOID THIS PROFESSOR!!",
