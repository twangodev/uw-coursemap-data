Exams were all essay, but he gave the questions out a week ahead of time and allowed one sheet of paper (dbl sided) for use on the exam.  Five possible questions were handed out prior; 4 were on the exam.  Very easy grader, loves what he teaches . . . take for easy ethnic studies.",

I called his phone all summer which had no voicemail whatsoever.  NEVER REPLIED even in the end. I handed in work & passed",
