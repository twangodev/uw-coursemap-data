Jampa realizes that most of the people in 268 are taking it because they're just interested in the content, so he doesn't kill you with tons of hw or hard tests but instead makes super interesting lectures (often with guest speakers) so you can just listen and learn. Great class",

Attendance is mandatory but very easy to do other homework during class. Syllabus states books are required but readings are posted so don't buy the books.
