He likes to ask questions on exams that are variations of practice, but with huge curveballs. Curve is pretty generous. Also he's absurdly Chicago school anti-keynesian and doesn't teach anything keynesian.",

Hardest class ever. Part of the problem was changing the book. Past exam that he gave you does not help at all. I am seriously concerning about changing my major.",
