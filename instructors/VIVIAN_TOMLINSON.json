The class isn't that hard, but it isn't paced well so you will be forced to cram a lot in the last month or so. The other crappy part is that for ANY Dance 41 class you have to attend 3 outside dances and write 2 papers based off shows you have to go see.",

We spent 2 months on the waltz and had only couple days at the end of the semester to learn swing and tango. Very easy to get an A, but if you want to actually learn dancing, I would take a different professor.",
