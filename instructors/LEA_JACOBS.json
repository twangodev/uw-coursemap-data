She teaches in stories, which makes things interesting and easier to remember and learn long term.  She's NOT a teacher that knows a lot and teaches @ students and expects them to remember. recommend!",

Plays obvious favorites, gives seemingly arbitrary grades and then refuses to explain the rationale behind them, woefully distracted during lectures.
