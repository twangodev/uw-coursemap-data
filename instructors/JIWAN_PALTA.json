If you have a secondary interest in horticulture (ie, this isn't your major) you're probably going to have a bad time.

There is no homework or papers and the grade is based on exams.  But he gives study aids and does a review before the exam.  The class was easy, but it was because of Prof Palta's great teaching style.",

Tests are very specific (you need to memorize exact values) but he gives you study guides and uses the same exams every year.  Try to get your hands on a previous copy.  It helps!  Good class!
