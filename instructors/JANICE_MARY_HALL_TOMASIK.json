She always messed up her demos and didn't know how to answer people's questions. Some quizzes weren't bad, but most were too long. The average in my discussion section was usually a D. Good luck if you have, you'll need it!",

She couldn't take the hint that an extra 5 minutes at the end of class would help for her impossible quizzes... instead made early friday mornings a requirement so that we'd &quot;have more time&quot;. She also disregarded showing any opposing viewpoints after giving a survey on moving quizzes to fridays. not a fan",
