He provides clear and detailed assignment writeups which help you apply the weekly lecture topics in C++. I stopped showing up to lectures and just learned the syntax on the fly. He did his best to make the assignments fun and always snuck a few jokes in the writeups. 70% to pass.",

Each week he gives us approximate dates we can expect grades/assignments to be released by, and he consistently goes days--if not WEEKS--past those dates. Also, projects are often busywork-heavy and feel hastily thrown together.",
