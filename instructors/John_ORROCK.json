His lectures can be really boring though as well as his slides that are most of the time blank, which he then writes the answers on the board which is time consuming and annoying if you want to look at slides online later. Pretty easy, just be sure to take good notes & stay awake.",

Information is easy to understand and very interesting. Wish he taught more than 3 weeks of the class. Looked forward to his lectures and would often be upset when the 50 minutes were up.",
