My one issue with the class was that the syllabus was constantly changing and sometimes you didn't know which readings were due when. She would ultimately clarify and it was never a big deal. Easy A if you come to class!!!",

There is A LOT of reading she assigns, but I did none of it and I was fine. She summarizes the important points in class. Participate &amp; be invested in class and you'll get an A!",
