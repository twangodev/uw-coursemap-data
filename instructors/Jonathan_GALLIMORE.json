He kept you on track with weekly assignments and constantly reminded you of deadlines. His tests are average but are not heavy in the gradebook. There is no curve but the tests are only out of 30 points.",

The lectures are worthless and he just goes over what is in textbook. There are four tests that are not curved and he makes every question a \u201ctrick question\u201d. Even if you know the material you will still not get a perfect score. Terrible.",
