Lentz is very knowledgable and keeps lectures interesting. He provides guidelines and examples about homework. You can even use A4 list of notes during exams. However, prepare to spend many hours of studying.",

If you talk to him, and ask him general questions he will answer them, I have done well on all the assignments and put in a bit of work, they are tough, but do-able. Make sure to pay attention to his slides and what he says in class",
