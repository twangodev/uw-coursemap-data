His approach fosters anxiety, hinders learning, and erodes confidence, stifling growth.",

The course content seemed to be concise and as industry-applicable as possible. The final project seemed a little hectic at times but in the end was not too bad and was reasonable in its demands in my opinion. Overall great professor!",
