Her Math 341 lectures were very clear and engaging as she introduced key ideas of linear algebra through systems of equations before moving to abstract vector spaces. I really enjoyed her lectures. She was always happy to discuss even my off-topic measure theory questions. Highly recommend!",

I would suspect that people underrate her because they were personally confused by the course material and dissatisfied when they received back poor test results. There is agency from the students to do well and the teacher to be pedagogically sound, and I think she did the best on her part to teach the material.",
