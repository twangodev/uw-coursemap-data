Do all of the readings and utilize the reading guides (which are helpful for the quizzes). Not a tough grader, and always willing to meet for office hours. I highly recommend taking a class with him.",

He's a great at leading discussion and makes you really think at how you can better our health care system. Participation counts towards your grade, so it pushes you to voice out your opinions. You learn a lot! I loved this class.",
