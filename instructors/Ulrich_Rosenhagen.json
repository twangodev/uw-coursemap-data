The theory is very obscure and he makes you relate it to the readings which means you really have to engage with the material to get a decent grade. He doesn't lecture, but I wish he would because he's a very smart guy. The whole 75-minute class is basically spent discussing the readings, which gets awkward &amp; boring",
