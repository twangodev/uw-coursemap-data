But where he really excels is in explaining concepts in just the right amount of depth to fully understand them, without wasting time or making things confusing. So he's very knowledgeable, sure, but he's also just downright great at instruction.",

I think the course arrangement should really be refined.",

Also very easy to get an A in the class so you don't have to worry about your grade, just focus on learning. Exams were similar to homework, and there were extra credits at the end.",

Also really appreciated his sense of humor and how comfortable he is with his students!",

He is really friendly and caring, he is willing to explain the concept to you in class if you dont get it. There are 8 homework, 4 projects, and 4 exams. 1 extra credit will be given at the end",
