Lectures, however, were engaging and covered a broad range of ideas.  Reading the materials is recommended but not necessary.  Easy to get an A or AB.  Only 2 tests and 1 lecture. No final!!",

Discussion is mandatory but good for review and group input. 1 paper to do-not that big of a deal, reading is sometimes boring, sometimes not.",
