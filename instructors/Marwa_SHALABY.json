She is so helpful, even letting you redo essays because she truly wants you to learn and not worry about your grade. Her passion for what she teaches is infectious. She is extremely witty and blunt, which i found hilarious. I completely recommend her if you have to opportunity.",

Marwa is smart, funny, kind, and open-minded. She is a very nuanced person, so if you don't like being shown all sides of things, you won't like her. She speaks Arabic, English & probably more",
