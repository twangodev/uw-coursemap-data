Had to learn re-learn assembly with 3 weeks left. It is THE HARDEST UNIT and he saves it until the end and had over half the endterm on it. Also participation is a bit subjective. HW5 was a blast tho.",

He'll spend 10 minute wasting time on something irrelevant, and speed through confusing material. Hard to keep up, and overall not a good speaker. Approximately 100 &quot;uhms&quot; and &quot;ahs&quot; per minute, making it very hard to pay attention.",

Transition to online was seamless and I highly recommend.",
