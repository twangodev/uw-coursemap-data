A LOT of reading, that wasn't always pertinent. That being said, he was very helpful and enthusiastic. It's better to think of the class as History of the LACK of European Democracy.",

He can talk a bit fast sometimes, but if you ask him to slow down, he will.  Really fun class.  Be ready to work though.  This guy knows his stuff.",

The lectures are conducted in Warp speed, the readings are dense primary sources upwards of 100 pages a week.  Not to mention the exams and papers deal extensively with the readings.  The material is somewhat interesting, but workload makes this a truly detestable class.",
