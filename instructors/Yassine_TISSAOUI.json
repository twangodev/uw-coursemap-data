The only bad thing about his lectures is there is a lot of content he covers within a short period of time(which is probably due to the course structure) and his handwriting isn't the best either. But he is probably one of the better lecturers for MATH 340, so I would recommend him. ",

There is a book to read before class, but lecture takes care of it. His handwriting is be desired at many moments. Complex ideas weren't articulated as clearly one wanted. A lot of times there was a question of \"why\".",
