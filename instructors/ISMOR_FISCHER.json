The only bad part is, is that he seems like a nice guys, just a really bad teacher.  ALSO the HW takes hours to do think 30 problems.  I beg of you take someone else!!!",

The tests usally follow his old exams, but the second one we had, did not at all, and was quite frustrating.  I would say take someone else, he makes the class harder than it should be.",

I basically had to teach myself all of the material along with the help of my roommate. Those that find this class easy are probably those that like this method of teaching or has had previous experience with stats. I would recommend some other prof.",

He is a very friendly professor (no many of them on this campus) that really wants his students to get it. His tests are hard but doable, come well prepared for the exams and don't be afraid to ask questions in class, he really likes it.",
