Very nice guy, very friendly.  Attendence to class is not necessary, as all the notes are given to you.  Just do the homework, read the textbook and do practice exams and you'll be fine.",

The only bad part is, is that he seems like a nice guys, just a really bad teacher.  ALSO the HW takes hours to do think 30 problems.  I beg of you take someone else!!!",

The tests usally follow his old exams, but the second one we had, did not at all, and was quite frustrating.  I would say take someone else, he makes the class harder than it should be.",

Those that find this class easy are probably those that like this method of teaching or has had previous experience with stats. I would recommend some other prof.",
