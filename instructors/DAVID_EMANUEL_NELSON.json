Exams require tons of memorization and can therefore be hard but thats biochemistry. Graded on historical curve and we rocked it, 37% of the class got A, 13% got AB.",

At review sessions he just talks and make hand gestures rather than actually writing things down. The assigned readings and optional problems do NOT match up with the lectures.",
