While the title seems a bit underwhelming, you will learn a lot from this class through the different projects and especially in lab. Exams were definitely more of an assessment of if you did the lectures and readings vs. your ability to regurgitate information from memory. Great class, you wont regret it.",

One of the best classes to take if you wanna get the digital studies certificate, and the projects are fun to do and very easily graded. Exams are on canvas and you can go through your notes while taking them. Overall, fantastic experience.",
