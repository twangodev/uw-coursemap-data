She is uncaring, and the way she speaks to us in class and writes her announcements (aggressive & rude: and she deleted them later!!!) demonstrates a poor attitude. Her lectures are biased and you must write papers according to her opinions to pass (lack of free thought). Don't take her classes!!!",
