Whenever things went wrong/tests didn't go as planned, she never blamed the class and always made accommodations so we could succeed. I'm not a huge history person, but I enjoyed what I learned and History 101 is a great class to take when you have a heavy workload otherwise.",

No homework so your grade relies heavily on your quizzes and papers. Questions on quiz will have to do with very specific things that were in your text book so I hope you are a good reader.",
