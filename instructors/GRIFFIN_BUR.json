Even two submissions for assignments regarding the most difficult content (mid-semester). Lectures are dense, but digestible. Easily accessible outside the classroom. Great to talk, caring, and inspiring. Great guy!",

There's a lot of homework, but you just have to do well on the data analysis projects.& Go to his office hours!!",
