The examples on notes are quite simple based on the theory, but the difficulty of questions on exams are way above the homeworks and examples on notes, and lectures are boring, no records of lectures, and hard to follow.

Lecture examples were too superficial to translate to the homework, in turn making exam preparation more difficult. Also, I believe her sections had lower exam averages than others.

We only use fill-in-the-blank note sheets and almost all of the notes are theorems without numbers or very basic level examples. This leaves us super confused when homework/tests come around and we see more complicated questions. The questions on the homework are often nothing like the notes.",

Watching Youtube videos to learn will be better than going to her lecture. Give a lot of materials to study for the exam, which is a good thing. ",

She dives pretty deep into simpler concepts that won't help too much on the homework. Overall, unorganized and dense lectures, would avoid.",
