He is willing to give you as much effort as you put in, therefore as long as you give the class the effort it deserves youll have a great time! He also leaves great comments in canvas and in class to motivate students to work harder. Really the only prof. I had that didnt talk down to the students.",

There were three major projects that your grade depends on but they are easy to get A's on and he gives good feedback.",
