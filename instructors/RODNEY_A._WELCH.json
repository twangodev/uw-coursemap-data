The book isn't essential, but I read it before the exams and I think it helped.  And it's pretty good, so I'll be holding onto it.  The exams are easy if you study a little, and the class is really interesting.  Take it!",

Don't waste your money on the book unless you usually need to read for clarification.  Better yet, go in on one book with a couple people...trust me.  His TA goes fast, so print slides before her lectures.",
