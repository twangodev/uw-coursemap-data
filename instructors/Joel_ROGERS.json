Professor Rogers rants for the entire lecture and says nearly nothing relevant ",

I stopped going to lectures because his ramblings were so left orientated and condescending to opposite views, and he spends most of the 2.5 hours muttering instead of teaching, so tests are a little tricky even if you read. Clearly doesn't want to be there. Avoid!",
