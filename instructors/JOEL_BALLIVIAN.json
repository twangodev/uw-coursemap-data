It is obvious he puts in work, cares about each and every student. I think every student left this class better for having taken it. Easy to tell he is passionate about what he does. ",

Basically, you just have to show up to class. We learned about feminism, racial justice, gender justice, morals, poverty ethics, and comedy. He cares about his students' learning and changing the world for better!",

Not too difficult a class; we only had 6 smallish assignments + the final exam. Attendance/participation was graded pretty heavily, but he is very lenient about excusing absences. All-in-all an amazing professor.",
