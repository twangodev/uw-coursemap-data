Seems to genuinely care about her students and is passionate. Here lectures are most certainly not boring. I would recommend taking her, but this class isn't easy if you're looking for an easy A.",

Homework was pretty challenging as it was worth less than 10 points, so a couple points off meant a bad grade. You had to explain everything in depth and it often wasn't clear what she was looking for in a response. Otherwise, I recommend!",
