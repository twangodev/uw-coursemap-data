The first few weeks of drills are tiring and repetitive, but it ends up being worth it once you start dueling.

After about two weeks of walking to the Nat, I decided that I could use some extra sleep instead of fencing practice. I did great on the practical examinations (75% of your grade) but failed both written and ended with BC",

If you try in class it's hard not to get at least an AB. I'm taking my third fencing class with him, that should tell you something. He also has some pretty good stories if you can get him to tell them. Cool guy.",
