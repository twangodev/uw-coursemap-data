Was readily available when I needed her help with homework or other questions. Tests really are not bad if you simply study.

Even brought her Spanish-fluent daughter to class to sing songs to us. Stacy speaks quickly, but with a nice yankee accent so it's easy to understand, relatively speaking. You would be lucky to be in her class.",
