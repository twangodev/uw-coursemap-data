If you're constantly late or say stupid things, he absolutely WILL call you out on it, as you deserve. 736 is not much work other than reading and a project, but if you can't participate in class, he will ramp things up quickly.",

Both have been reasonable and of the two semester I have had him, his class has been one of my favorites and most interesting. He is a nice guy, gives lots of anecdotes to make things interesting and he doesn't believe in tests. Talk periodically in class and you will get an 'A'.",

The class consists of weekly quizzes ,programs and an optional final. Quizzes are reasonable and the programs aren't overwhelming either. Not a lot of work for a 500 level class.",
