She always ended class early and it usually went by pretty fast. Tests were like middle school tests. (EASY) couple papers tho. Shes intimidating at first, but cool once u get to know her.",

Jumbled, incomprehensible direction in lecture, poor public speaking ability, reads 50-word lecture slide quotations verbatim, and takes frequent long pauses between ideas that are supposed to be connected. Moreover, she has legitimately been wrong on content before. Hope she'll get better at her job.",
