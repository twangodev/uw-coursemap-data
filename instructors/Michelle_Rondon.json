She always willing to help. And of course you have to come to every lecture. As long as you don't fall asleep for this 8 am lesson, it's really one of the easiest Biology courses.",

Going to lecture is very important because the exams are based heavily on what she says and not only what is in the notes. She is always willing to help.  Great Teacher.",
