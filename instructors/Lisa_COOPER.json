Cooper can be intimidating, but she once you get past this you can see that she is a true expert in the field and passionate about what she teaches.",

Cooper is pretty engaging, and though she can come off as mean, she's actually pretty funny, nice, and approachable. Grades are completely up to TA, so hope for a good one-close read like your life depends on it.",
