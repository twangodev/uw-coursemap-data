Your grade is based solely on 2 midterms & final (you can drop the lowest midterm) Exams are multiple choice which makes it hard. Interesting class but only take if you need it.

You can tell he's used to teaching upper level courses because he expected us to know a lot more than we actually did. He once asked us if we knew what a hockey stick was though. Powerpoints are all pictures, no words. Hard to follow.",
