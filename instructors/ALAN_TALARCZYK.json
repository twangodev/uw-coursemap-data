If you just know where the rules are but don't remember them, you probably won't have time to find them in the book",

Tax is the most demanding subject within accounting, so 2 days per chapter is not sufficient. Perhaps removing some material and focusing more could help students, but that doesn't seem to be Al's goal.",
