If you are recruiting for banking and have prior knowledge coming in, the class won't be too bad. No busy work and all assignments help you learn content. Pitchbook takes time so plan ahead.

There is no shortcut, you have to put 100% efforts. But you will learn a lot from it. I believe FIN420 is the best course of WSB, which is taught by a wonderful lecturer. Take it for sure, Marisa won't let you down.",
