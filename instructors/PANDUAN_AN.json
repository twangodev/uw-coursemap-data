Not really helpful when asking her a question because most of the time she can't explain it well. The worst thing was that she was not consistent on her exam policies, and her exams' difficulty could really differ from the practice",

She doesn't explain things well and generally doesn't teach things well either. Do not take this class with her. Worst prof",
