This being said, if you don't have a stats background class can be really tough. Studying for the midterm can seem impossible because the material is extremely unpredictable.",

He truly cares about his students and is brilliant. I hope I get to take a class with him, and am so bummed he only taught 1/3 of the class. Crabb, you rock!",

It's as simple as, if you don't show up, you won't pass and if you DO show up, you'll still be confused. It's a REALLY tough module so start reviewing from Day 1. Rumor is most students fail the module 2 exam - GL!",
