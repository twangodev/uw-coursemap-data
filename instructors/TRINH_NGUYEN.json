His English is terrible and he's *extremely* difficult to understand, which is bad for as difficult a class as real analysis, since he doesn't explain concepts well at all. Very harsh grader on exams--prepare to get almost no partial credit. I got an A but it took all I had. PLEASE AVOID.",

His English is hard to understand and no practice exams. In addition, exams are graded really hard in small details and weighted reall high. And the exam styles are not consistent. Lots of HW. Avoid at all cost.",
