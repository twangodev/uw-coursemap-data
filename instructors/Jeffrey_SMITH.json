Paper assignments were relatively open-ended and no rubric, so his grading could feel a bit arbitrary, but I wouldn't say it's unfair. Would totally recommend him as a prof.",

Oh and go to Jeff's office hour and talk to him he's amazing!!!",

However, he sometimes gets a little sucked into his own fine details that eventually make it into the extremely specific exam questions. Other than that, he's an extremely middle-of-the-road professor.",
