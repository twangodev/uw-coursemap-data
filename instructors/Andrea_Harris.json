This course has no exam but 2 essays based on readings. For international students like me, reading may be hard to understand sometime but she's always happy to help you. I am hoping to take her class again.",

She is especially great in making sure you're clear on the time line of events and how things link together.  You have almost-weekly quizzes, but they are easy if you pay attention and go over your notes. You will not be disappointed with a course from this woman!",
