She utilizes Google docs and other online platforms a lot so you don't have to print out much for your assignments and essays (trust me you'll want this), unlike some other 117 lectures I heard of. She emphasises group work, so you will actually get to know most of your classmates, which is a rare thing for college classes.",

The class does have a lot of reading (necessary) and papers (3 pg paper due nearly every week). The class is long, but usually goes relatively fast because she is good at fostering discussion. Overall a good class, but not super easy. ",
