The readings range from short paragraphs to longer stories that are enjoyable to read. She is old fashioned in which she has assignments and exams on paper, I found it very refreshing though! I recommend!",

It was a lit class for non-french speakers, and although I had no experience in reading translated French literature, she made me interested in them! She's a little old-fashioned (many homework assignments written on paper), but honestly I liked it. Would take a class with her in the future!",

She was very patient explaining the different sounds of the French language and teaching us the phonetic alphabet.
