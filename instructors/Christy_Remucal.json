Lectures are neatly done and have tons of consideration/refining done to them. Expectations for exams are super clear. She made an effort to tie everything we covered to real life examples which was amazing as well.",

There was a pretty hefty amount of chemistry used, but overall it was really nice. She does a \"hybrid\" class structure that really helps you learn through the semester. She wants her students to succeed, so grading isn't bad.",

Her first time teaching CEE 320; ended up enjoying this class more than any other that I've taken at the UW, but also left feeling like I learned so much. Talking with her outside of class played a major role in me switching majors to civil and environmental engineering.",
