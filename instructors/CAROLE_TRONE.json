Out of class final. Participation was a large grade and focused on online forums.  A good amount of reading is required.  Overall, she made a broad subject very interesting and entertaining.",

Extremely knowledgable, encourages class discussion, not too difficult, before this class i hated studying history but PRof Trone made is so enjoyable i actually liked class, one of the most approachable teachers ive had at UW",
