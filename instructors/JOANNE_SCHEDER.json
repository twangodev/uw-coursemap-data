If you can BS a paper and sit quietly in class this is the best ethnic course",

Small written assignments, attend a diversity dialogue, 3 quizzes (open book and open note), and read a reasonable amount each week. NO EXAMS! The info is usually interesting, and as long as you go you'd have to be an idiot not to get a B at least. So easy!!",
