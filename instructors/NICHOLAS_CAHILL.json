He has tons of enthusiasm for the subject and it was fairly interesting, but if you don't like memorizing tons and tons of objects and info for each test, don't take this class.",

If you are confused about something in class don't be afraid to ask him and look stuff up in the book.  A LOT OF MEMORIZATION, and studying before tests.  Go in for help if needed for papers",

There's a lot of memorization, so if you're pressed for time for some reason, you should consider an easier course. So far, though, this is my favorite course of the semester. If you like to learn new or interesting things, take it.",

It was a great class for AH majors and non AH majors alike.  Take the 4th credit because it is only a few extra pages on each paper and you can use a paper in place of the final.",
