The class material was fascinating; however, the final grade depends on 4 exams (the last is cumulative!!) an article response paper, and an essay on a book. So if you bomb an exam, it will tank your grade. The discussions are mandatory points, you only get one sick day, not worthwhile in my eyes.",
