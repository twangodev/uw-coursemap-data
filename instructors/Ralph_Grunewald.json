The format for tests depends if kids cheat or not, so you can go from being an open note test to an in person one. No curve, but I generally liked the subject matter. Professor Grunewald is caring but tough on students. ",

Lecture is engaging, but he is very strict about no phones, cheating, paying attention etc. Open-note weekly quizzes that help you get your grade up. Occasionally test questions can be weirdly specific but are usually fair. Take good notes. I totally recommend RG and this class. ",

He offers unique insight on criminal justice due to his real life and international experience within the law and innocence project. Paying attention to small details in this class can make a difference, graded only on exams and weekly quizzes which are not terribly difficult.",

Even in a lecture hall of 250 people, he made the most class time. The material was interesting and fun to learn about. I looked forward to attending class and discussion.",
