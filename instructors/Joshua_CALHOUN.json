This man is so passionate about what he teaches and makes the lectures super engaging, didn't read most of the plays tbh since what we went over in discussion plus reading some of them in high school. Pay attention to lectures and you'll def pass the exams.",

We only had 1 exam, but he didn't want to give me extra time. He also wouldn't allow make-up quizzes (which are weekly), so I would get a 0 if I couldn't come to class that day.",

Calhoun does a great job highlighting what's important.",
