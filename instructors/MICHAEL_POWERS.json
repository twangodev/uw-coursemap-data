People criticize him because they don't understand what he says when in reality its mostly the students (one's not particularly strong in math). If you're struggling and need help, he is more than willing to help you (he's not there to babysit you and make sure you're learning). It's college lol.",

He never comes prepared and when he does work in front of the class, he always does a different, more confusing way that the book isn't teaching us to do. He'll have half of the problem done and then say that everything is wrong and he has to start again. Lecture is pointless, you have to teach yourself",
