There is homework every night but the worksheets take an hour at most.  The exams are extremely fair and doable if you go to class, do the homework, and study a little more beyond that.  I would definitely take it again with Anna!",

She often encouraged us to sit with different people, which gave the opportunity to get to know everyone. Also, at the end of the semester we had a potluck with a movie. I sincerely loved going to class!",

I would take another class with her in a heartbeat!",
