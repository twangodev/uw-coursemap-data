You don't learn anything of substance and Liad makes this worse by monotonously reading off the lecture slides. This class made me wish I wasn't a marketing major.",

Introduces assignments 3 days before they are due which is frustrating to plan. Calls his exams &quot;quizzes&quot; and they are on the smallest details in the readings/podcasts. Take the other prof.",

We spent nearly half the class on freshman level psychology/introductory marketing concepts which was confusing because this a capstone course for seniors. He never challenges you to think critically but will cold call on the most random questions. Overall a disappointing last class of my major.",
