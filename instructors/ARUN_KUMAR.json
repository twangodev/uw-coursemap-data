The course content really sucks, but I think that Paris Koutris (the actual professor) has full control over this, and Arun just has to deal with it. I do recommend him highly, but not for 564 with Paris.",

The worst part , the average for both projects and exams is only 50%. Avoid him and Paris.",

Homework is also very tough (you can compare it with the same course taught by other professors). Avoid him unless no other choice (maybe wait for another semester). BTW, he discourage email .",
