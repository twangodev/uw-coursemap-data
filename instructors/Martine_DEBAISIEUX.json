There is lots of literature (poems, stories, novels) that you must read in order to know what's going on. She's nice and wants to help when she can.",

Assigns a lot of reading - easy to get by in class without doing so but you have to keep a reading journal which she grades at the end of the semester. Cares about you and your success, not the easiest grader at times but well-thought of overall. Definitely would take her again.",
