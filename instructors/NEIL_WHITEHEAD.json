I say that it was nice because all we did everyday was watch crappy old educational movies from the 70s and 80s. I was bothered by the smell of cigarette smoke :(",

It was team taught and of the two profs, while Whitehead talked a lot, he didn't coddle us like Wofford did.  He lets you do your own thing for the term paper and allows you to talk in class if you want to, but doesn't insist upon it.  I really liked this class.",
