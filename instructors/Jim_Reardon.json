He only takes attendance on Fridays but homework is due on Wednesdays so you have to be in class for that too. Tests are a little difficult but he gives extra credit worksheets after exams to get missed points back which is nice. Homework packets are kind of long.",

Exams can be rough and challenging along with the homework, but he allows you do makeup lost points with extra credit worksheets. You have unlimited tries on the worksheet but you must get all the questions right to makeup lost points. He does extra credit projects you makeup too. ",

Can get points for as simple as raising your hand to answer a question or emailing a picture of a cheetah to him. No cumulative exams, and can make up lost points with worksheets.",

Homework and exams can be tough at times, but you could get 200% in the course if you did all the extra credit opportunities, so you can really get any grade you want in this class.
