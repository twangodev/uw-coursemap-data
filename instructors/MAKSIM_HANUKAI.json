He's really serious, but he's very modest &amp; is always willing to answer questions, help, etc. You can only miss three classes (there's a sign in sheet), so that was rather painful. You're expected to do a lot of readings, but only 3 shorter papers. Lit is not my strong suit, so this was more challenging for me.",
