The class is easy but TA's grade hard on open response so beware of that. Dr Schalk is nice but you never see her besides lecture. Class is very content heavy but is easy.",

The only thing I didn't like about the course was the way class time was organized. The activities and discussions seemed experimental and often didn't work for me.",

There is only two exams and one book report which makes the class easy to understand. As long as you watch lecture and read you'll do great. ",

Sami also made sure that students knew they were worth more than just a grade.",

She is hilarious and super understanding- reminds you of your worth as a person outside of grades and academia. Incorporates intersectionality in a holistic/welcoming way. Can't recommend enough.",
