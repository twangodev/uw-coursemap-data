One of the biggest complaints about psych classes are the copious amounts of required readings. That was not the case here. I spent very little time outside of class on assignments, yet I still learned a lot. Highly recommend!",

If you turn in your work on time and study properly (she teaches you how!), you will do well and learn a lot! Never met her personally as it was online, but she seems nice from the instruction videos. Would 100% recommend!",
