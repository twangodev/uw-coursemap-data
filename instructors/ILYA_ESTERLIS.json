He provides resources for the class and posts his lecture notes online. His class is not attendance-mandatory but it is strongly encouraged. Plus, his lectures are awesome so you don't want to miss them anyway. Highly recommend. ",

He speaks clearly, explains things well, and manages to communicate the profundity of, for example, symmetry and conservation laws.  The class was very tough, but homework counts for a lot of your grade, and it's more than worth the challenge.",

However, he is willing to answer any questions during and after class, and really strives for our understanding. Overall a nice man with good handwriting.",
