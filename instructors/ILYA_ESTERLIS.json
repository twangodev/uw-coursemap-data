He taught in a way that made the concepts extremely interesting and incredibly easy to learn (which is saying something from a 400 level physics course). Lecture notes are well-crafted and his assigned homework is really interesting, applicable and fun to solve. Over all, he is the best professor I have ever had.",

Despite the difficulty of the content, you will walk away feeling accomplished.",

He provides resources for the class and posts his lecture notes online. His class is not attendance-mandatory but it is strongly encouraged. Plus, his lectures are awesome so you don't want to miss them anyway. Highly recommend. ",

He speaks clearly, explains things well, and manages to communicate the profundity of, for example, symmetry and conservation laws.  The class was very tough, but homework counts for a lot of your grade, and it's more than worth the challenge.",
