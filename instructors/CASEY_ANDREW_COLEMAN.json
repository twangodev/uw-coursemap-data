The TA's are what made this class absolutely awful, especially mine who just enjoyed to hear herself talk and didn't care about the students. I don't recommend this class to anyone.",

The projects are vague and preparing for tests consists of memorizing his opinions. Best part of the class was when the engineer prof. came in and dissed him.",

Only complaint is that some questions on his tests are misleading and have more than one correct answer.  Definitely try to go in and argue.",
