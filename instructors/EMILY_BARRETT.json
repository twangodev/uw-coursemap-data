The class was fun and mostly just talking through philosophy and contemporary works. Just expect to read a lot for the first part of the class. It's a comm-b class so there are debates and a presentation. I would totally take a class by her again.",

Philosophy isnt usually my cup of tea but I found the lectures interesting, which was very impressive because it was her first semester as a lecturer. What you are graded on is very clear cut and if you put in the (reasonable) amount of work required, youll come out with a good grade.",

We only had 3 summary papers, 4 short and scheduled reading quizzes, and one final that our grade was based off of. You can still do well by only reading the readings for the quizzes and last minute studying for the final.",
