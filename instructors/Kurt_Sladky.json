The exams were challenging yet fair, but he adjusted grade cutoffs appropriately. Lectures are super important! Overall, he is a really caring professor who wants to see students succeed. I'd recommend to anyone !",

Sladky also send out a good summary of one really poor lecture given by a guest lecturer. His own lectures were really straight forward.",
