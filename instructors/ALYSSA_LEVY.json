I will admit that some of the reading is a little loftier than other 100-level courses, but she explains well in lecture, and she gives very clear instructions for assignments.  I would take any other classes this professor offered.",

Wouldn't call it an easy A, but if you show a genuine interest and effort through your papers and participation, you'll get a good grade.

Extremely detailed pop quizzes.  Note outlines are either too detailed or not detailed enough.  Won't take a class of her again.  But maybe this is all inexperience, maybe she'll improve...",
