Content entails a lot of memorization, but he provided clear notesheets to study for--wonderful for preparing students for his exam.

His teaching is not so much teaching, but spitting out facts for students to memorize.  We don't need teachers for this, so his job is essentially void.  If attendance were not mandatory, the book could easily replace him.",
