He kind of repeats the books over in lecture, but if you miss attending those you won't do well.  He gives a lot of background to the plays you read, and those are pretty essential.  Otherwise, a slightly boring lecture.",

My TA as really terrible, and gave pop quizes, so avoid Kerry Lefebvre if possible. Easy Multiple choice midterm and exam. The COMB meant a lot of papers, but all of them were short.",

Generally an easy course, but for tests he will throw some difficult questions on there (not many, but a few). Very easy course and I'd recommend it to anyone needing to fill a literature requirement.",
