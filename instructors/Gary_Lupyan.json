Just prepare--understand readings, study notes.",

Lots of readings, but interesting. Discussions are nice help, though make sure to participate to get a good participation grade. Overall, great class and one of the best psych profs. ",

Just because an article is assigned doesn't mean you have to agree with it. Topics and lecture style are super engaging and interesting. Even if language isn't exactly your thing, I highly recommend this course.",
