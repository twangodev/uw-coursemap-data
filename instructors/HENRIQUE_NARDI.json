Didn't grade any of our projects until the last half of the semester which was a bit annoying, but he gives you time to resubmit your work for a higher grade if you want",

As long as you try your best, show your design process, &amp; make improvements to your projects you will do well. Some of the quizzes were tough but he offered extra credit to fix the poor grade",
