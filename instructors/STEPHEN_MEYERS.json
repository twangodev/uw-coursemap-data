He gives test questions to you in lecture, so it makes it easier to just sit and absorb what he is saying. This also helps a lot when you have 40% of the test questions and answers before the actual test day (word for word)!!",

Studied from lecture \"road maps\" that he puts online, filled in the blanks, and got an A on the midterm. He puts the lecture slides online too. An easy and fun science class with lab credit. Paying attention is critical to getting good grades.",

He gives you exam questions in lecture, which is a plus. However, when it comes to exam time you end up at a loss for what to study because his lectures are so random and he doesn't use the textbook at all.",
