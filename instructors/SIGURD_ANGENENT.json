His lectures are confusing and off topic and his book is almost word for word what he says in class so learning on your own is extremely difficult. Also, his tests are way different then what he says they'll be like prior to taking them. DON'T take his class!!",

The answers he gives for HW have a lot of errors which is a pain. Tests were fair but the classes he teaches are pretty hard. Sigurd is really quirky and speaks perfectly clear. Liked him enough to take again",

You don't have to take notes on them or know them for the tests, except for frickin epsilon-delta proofs. His wife taught my class the last two weeks, and she was a lot clearer.",
