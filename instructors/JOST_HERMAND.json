Professor Hermand actually lived in Germany during Nazi rule and even met Hitler at one point, his story is phenomenal and it was amazing to have the chance to hear him speak. I learned so much in this class, and it is by far one of my favorites of college. He does talk pretty fast though, so be prepared for note taking.",

If you go to class and read what you're suppose to , you'll be fine, his expectations are not unnecessary high.
