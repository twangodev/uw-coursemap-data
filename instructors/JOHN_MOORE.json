His exams are difficult and you will definitely see things on there that you have never seen before, which sucks because the exams are not curved.  If you are pre-med, take 103-104 instead...otherwise you'll have to take Analytical Chemistry.",

Tough class though.  Cover a lot of material in one semester.  Honors project is stupid, but an easy A for an assignment.  Great professor, very approachable.  Take him.",
