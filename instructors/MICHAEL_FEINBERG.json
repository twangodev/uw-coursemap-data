He helped me thrive in AH 355 despite all of my personal struggles, and I am thankful to have been in his class.",

However, he is also the only professor who actually taught me how to write an essay. He is also the only one who actually reads what I wrote and gave me feedback. Do not take him if you are hoping for an easy A.",

He helped me not only become a better writer but to also become more confident in my abilities as a student. I'd take him again in a second. Oh, and you will get an A if you try and show improvement.",
