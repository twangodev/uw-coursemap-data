She is aware that many of the cultural beliefs and concepts can seem very foreign to students and does an excellent job at explaining them.  This course made me pursue a certificate in American Indian Studies.  She really wanted her students to do well.  Great course for AIS!",

In a class of mostly junior and senior English majors, I don't appreciate her stopping lecture to make sure we know what romanticism is (or allusions!).
