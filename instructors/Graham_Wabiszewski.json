You can seriously tell he cares about his students and the curriculum and overall made the class enjoyable. It isn't nerve wrecking to ask him questions either. ",

You will learn a lot, and this class helped me to get my first internship. ",

The expectations were clearly laid out and if you took the time to attend office hours, the course load and complexity of assignments were easy to complete and understand. Lectures were a bit all over the place at first, but as the semester continued, they were very helpful. Good intro class.",
