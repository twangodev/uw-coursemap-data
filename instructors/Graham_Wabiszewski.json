You can seriously tell he cares about his students and the curriculum and overall made the class enjoyable. It isn't nerve wrecking to ask him questions either. ",

Some of the things you will learn in this course is Solidworks, statics, electricity, and more. In the end you will use these topics you learned to help construct a final project with a group.",

You will learn a lot, and this class helped me to get my first internship. ",

The expectations were clearly laid out and if you took the time to attend office hours, the course load and complexity of assignments were easy to complete and understand. Lectures were a bit all over the place at first, but as the semester continued, they were very helpful. Good intro class.",
