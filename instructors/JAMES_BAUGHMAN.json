The reading for the class is insane, do it or you will struggle.  Sometimes there would be a comment thrown that was borderline offensive but he's an older gent so keep that in mind.",

Baughman makes up for his odd comments throughout lectures with fantastic help on your writing, and for a class on creative non-fiction, he gives both great and horrible examples for class-wide critique. Speak up in class, and go to his office hours, you won't regret it! Must love Pez.",

Not as difficult as I thought it would be.",

As a history major the class was not as challenging as I thought it would be. Felt watered down compared to other upper level history classes.
