There were 5 to write but you got to skip one. I skipped my last paper so I could quit going to lecture a month early. This was a smart move. The papers are graded by your TA. ",

The class was only graded out of 80 points which come from 4 papers and attendance, so it's hard to get a good grade, in my opinion. The premise of the class seemed super interesting but wasn't well executed.",

If you're incredibly interested in religion, maybe you would like it, but probably not. The readings are frequent, dense, and hard to decipher, and also very long. Slow readers need not take this course.",
