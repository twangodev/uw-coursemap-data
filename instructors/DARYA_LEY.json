Russian is definitely a difficult language to learn and you will need to dedicate a fair amount of time to the class. She is very helpful and has clear expectations. Participation is required. The textbook is used everyday. Homework is assigned everyday and it is mandatory.",

Combined, attendance and nightly homework account for 30% of your final grade and she cold-calls, so expect to work hard inside and outside of class. If you're interested in trying out Russian, I would highly recommend taking her.",
