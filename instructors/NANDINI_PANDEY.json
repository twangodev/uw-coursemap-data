She focuses on the details a bit but the check ins are easy if you pay attention and always open note, discussions with her were great. Would 100% recommend",

She utilized many different methods to teach us like listening to lectures, doing check ins, a group project, only 1 paper (the final), and interactive discussion groups to talk about the books we read. It's a lot of reading, but you tend to skip around in the books so it's doable.",
