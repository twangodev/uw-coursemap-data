His lectures are entertaining and bawdy, he has an incredible passion for the material, and he obviously loves teaching. Lots of memorization and insect collecting is required, but it's worth it for the man.",

The best part of the class: no TAs, he does the lectures, labs, and field trips all himself. Very quick to grade and return things too. He acts very casual and is always reasonable. Highly recomended.",
