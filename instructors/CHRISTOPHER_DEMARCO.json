His lecture style consisted of reading off a set of handwritten notes, which were difficult to follow at times, and he didn't focus enough on problem-solving. This led to lecture attendance dropping greatly by the end of the semester. Class is test-heavy and exams are challenging, but he was a fair grader at least.",
