Not the brightest crayon in the box as shown by her inability to finish some easy stoich problems in lecture, but gives very reasonable tests. As long as you go to class, book reading isnt crucial to success and you should still be able to get an A-AB",

She was very reasonable with her coursework, and although she did include online work that required knowledge beyond what her lectures covered at the time, she only used it as a preview tool, which helped a lot. She uses her resources smartly. Great teacher, overall.",
