HORRIBLE lecturer for Dance 165- she will not offer further insight on the material, because she recites from a book rather than truly knowing the material as she should.",

Marlene is a great professor with a great eye for technique and artistry. She doesn't like affectation - she likes clarity, efficiency, and proper technique. Good for anyone who wants improve in ballet.",
