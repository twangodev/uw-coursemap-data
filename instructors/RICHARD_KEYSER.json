Very good lecturer, loves to talk with students and helped a lot",

His lectures are way too confusing, he jumps around on his thoughts and does not have clear outlines. He will randomly give pop quizzes, and for the quizzes he does tell his class about, they're impossible. The averages are always below 50%",

At times this can be motivating, but it mostly falls short and becomes demoralizing. I would not recommend this course, it was too time consuming with little reward.",
