Overall, she makes her students interested in the course work and is an awesome professor to have. 10/10 would recommend.",

If you take LACIS with her, make sure you take a lot of notes during her lectures (there is a lot information thrown at you) so that you do well on her tests. If you put in the effort, you should do well! Incredibly interesting class, especially ancient civilizations!",
