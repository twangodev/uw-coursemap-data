Don't get me wrong, I still don't really like it but Brachman at least made some of it interesting for me during lecture. Lecture is basically mandatory (you need to get a 65% on top hat for credit). The textbook is really only useful for learning vocal for exams.",

Overall, I was very satisfied with this course.",
