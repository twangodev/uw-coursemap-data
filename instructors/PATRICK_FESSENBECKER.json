Even with minimal notice, he took time out of his day to help me and I am forever appreciative for my time with him. ",

His course page was difficult to navigate and he didnt bother to tell students that the canvas grade does not represent the actual class grade. He also disregards parts of his own rubrics. Besides this, very good",

The pre class readings were about sometimes 4 hours with 1 day notice. His feedback is constructive, but often so harsh that picking a new topic was the only solution. I did ok in the class.",
