This class should only be in the AM!",

He will not give you an A for fluff, and you have to participate in his class. He isn't going to give you a good grade without putting in the work, but he teaches the way classes should be taught. Very highly recommend him.",

He's a tough grader and expects a lot, but if you put in the work you will come out far more prepared (especially if you're an engineer) for the business environment",
