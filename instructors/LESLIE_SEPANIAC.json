Her exam was incredibly difficult and as a first semester freshman, it was too much for me. She sped through her slides during lecture and its was incredibly hard to follow. Lots of pictures with very little description.",

Material was too in-depth for an intro course and did not matter for any other material. She expects you to remember every slide and lecture. My notecard on the exam was filled to the brim with as much info as I could. Worst exam of the class.",

However she was obviously not equipped to teach an introductory biology class. I would've failed if she was the teacher all year. Lecture slides had far too many words on them. She went through material way too fast.",
