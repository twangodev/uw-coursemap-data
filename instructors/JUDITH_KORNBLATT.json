The 4 credit section got to do take home easy exams, and the 3 credit section had ridiculous in-class essays and IDs in exams.  The lectures were great for short stories, then got really dry with the novels.  Not the best class at all.",

Lectures aren't too boring and some of the wacky stuff she talks about is good for a laugh.  Rushed essay tests, but you'll be OK if you're good at BS'ing.",
