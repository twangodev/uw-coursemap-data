Spend a lot of time on the homework, as it is worth 25% of your grade and will really help in preparing for the midterms.

It is very apparent that Professor Spagnolie has a love for math, and he wants to share it with his students.  Homework while long at times, really helps you understand the material.

He is very passionate about math and that is clear to see in his lecturing. Homework is reasonable and accounted for 1/4 of my final grade. I highly recommend reading the book to learn.
