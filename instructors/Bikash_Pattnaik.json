There was little organization of learning and material was hard to follow. The most perplexing part of the class was exams. Taking exams felt like solving puzzles and a lack of graded materials made doing well on exams pertinent to doing well overall.",

Additionally, he writes very ambiguous and unclear exams that can be difficult to understand what any given question is asking for. Would not recommend as you have no control over your own grade.",

He's a super sweet guy, though at times grading criteria was unclear (I would venture to say this is because he cares more about learning vs grading). Ask or email him your questions and he's happy to answer. 10/10 would recommend.",
