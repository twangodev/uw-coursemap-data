I feel like he can also organize his grading system better because setting all the scores to 0 at first and having them increase over the semester doesn't sound very appealing.",

There is a lot of reading and the exams are about the articles. His lectures were boring and didn't help for exam. This class isn't easy but it's not super hard either.",
