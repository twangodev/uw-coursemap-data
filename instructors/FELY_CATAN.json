Uses Mindtap for homework, and you need to buy it. ",

She is a really nice person and clearly knows a lot about critical theory, but this class was very easy and I didn't learn much. The class is supposed to be an intro to college writing, but we only wrote three short (2-3 pg) papers. She gave almost no criticism or feedback. Assigns good readings though.",
