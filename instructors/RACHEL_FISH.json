She uses research and academic works to convey messages about institutional discrimination. No exams! Essays were a bit tough. Readings were easy (but long). Fair grader. Always willing to help.

She stresses that white people shouldn't feel guilty about their whiteness - just aware. :) If you do oppose an idea in the class, she wasn't condescending. She wants to engage with her students in a positive way. Overall, I'd recommend her over other profs! She's SO helpful if you just reach out.",

The textbook taught from is written by a liberal extremist, therefore the class is taught from a very one-sided perspective. Aside from that, Rachel Fish is an effective lecturer and grades assignments fairly. If taking the class, I would definitely recommend taking it with her!!",
