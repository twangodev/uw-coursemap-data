She is always willing to chat before and after class. She's so knowledgeable & kind if you have questions or comments. Class is great because it's very low-stress. I love that Amy brings in local deaf/HH people for interviews.",

Brings in guest speakers and tries to make lectures interesting yet beneficial. Currently have a 105% in the class thanks to extra credit. As someone who's taking math, o-chem, and bio this class is saving my sanity",

Amy is an incredibly kind soul who is super passionate about activism in the d/Deaf community. She makes the class easy to get an A. ",

I came into 424 with little knowledge of ASL or the Deaf community, but she helped me feel comfortable in my signing and understanding of ASL. There were readings and &quot;sign times&quot; where we would watch her sign and then sign back. There were a few quizzes, an exam, and a final - all passable if you go to class",

As someone who came in with very little ASL experience, she made the class very accesible and learning new topics about ASL and the Deaf community every week was exciting and inspiring. Shes super receptive to questions and is available when you need her - and she gets work back very quickly, so thats a huge plus!",
