Weekly quizzes are pretty easy, especially if you do the readings. Overall a decent class, but definitely go to your TA for additional feedback on papers as the midterm is graded blind.",

As long as you make sure you stay caught up with doing the notes at home and go to discussion you'll be completely fine. There are super easy weekly quizzes that you can take twice and a short essay midterm and final essay. Didn't do any of the assigned readings and still got an A easily.",
