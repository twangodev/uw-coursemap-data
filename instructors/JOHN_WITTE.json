Public Policy is a rather dry subject, so don't expect too much out of the lectures but if you have some previous knowledge of polisci it shouldn't be too hard. There is a lot of reading but you don't really need to do it all to do well on the test. Be prepared for a 15 page paper though.",

The last comment is correct: you basically read the public policy textbook and have Witte regurgitate it for you, followed by him talking about his experience.  This isn't bad when it pertains, but he sometimes goes off on long tangents that make it hard to stay awake.  Moral of story: take at your own risk.",
