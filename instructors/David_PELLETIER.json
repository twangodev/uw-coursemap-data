The grade distribution on madgrades is understandably intimidating, but law is a hard field, so it's not like any other law class is gonna be easy. Prof Pelletier is super organized, understanding, and good at explaining things.",

I don't know what class they were taking, but David's Canvas page is the BEST and most well-organized class website I've had during my time at UW. Every time I feel confused about a topic in one of his lectures, it is always cleared up- his explanations are so simplistic and helpful. Reading the text isnt critical.",

They provides a lot of study material, but it often contradicts itself. Disorganized class, but not too difficult with practice. Don't bother reading the textbook.

Watch online lectures on 2x. For tests, review the outlines, attend the review session, do all the practice problems, and look at rubrics for past free response. Tests are very similar",

His tests & quizzes are pretty reasonable, too. I got thru the class by transcribing the videos he posted. I also suggest making flashcards, and treating things you learn as new vocab words.",
