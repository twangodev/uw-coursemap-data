Discussions are boring and all you read is black civil rights movement texts. If anything, this course should be an ethnic studies credit as well as com b. Skip this class..it's not all it's cracked up to be.",

Whether or not you need Comm B you should take this class and it will change your life.  Don't let the first day intimidate you, its not as difficult as she makes it out to be and you will be happy you stuck it out. Absolutely amazing, TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",

She's understanding, fun, intelligent, and arranges the curriculum around student interests. She's the best teacher I've ever had and I think she should be the professor of the year. She's so sweet. Seriously take a class with her.",

The papers were not graded yet the comments were better than any composition class I've taken.  The group-based activities made me write better.  Lots of reading and paper writing.  Great teacher, great class.",
