He gives you all the topics to know.  Just really study for the final and mid term.  If you study a good amount the tests are easy.  If you don't study fort the tests you WILL fail.",

All you have to do is come to class, read the book (which he writes), take the quizzes (you get two chances), and memorize stuff for the tests. If you actually read the book and just memorize the pictures you should get an easy A. He's also super into photography and I love it!",
