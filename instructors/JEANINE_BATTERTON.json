I took the summer term which goes fast, especially during lecture, but she welcomed questions if she had time. New & tough to begin, but a great prof overall. Get Jose Laboy for your TA & you'll be fine!!",

Chem 104 is a joke if you took chem AP in high school don't even bother studying because it is just a review.  If you took Chem 103 then you might learn SOME things but you can still get away with skipping lectures and reading the book the night before the exam.  Easy A here",

I would recommend her to anyone who has to take 104, her lectures are helpful and well organized, and she is always willing to help you if you go to office hours. Take Dr. Batterton!",
