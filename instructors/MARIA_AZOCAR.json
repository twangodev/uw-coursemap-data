If you have an opposing view she will shut you down and make the others students gang up on you. Avoid at all costs.",

If you have a different viewpoint than Maria, my advice would be to never speak up. More often than not Maria avoids facts in lecture and rather points to feelings to provide evidence. Do not take this class.",
