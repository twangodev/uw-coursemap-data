Tests are fine if you read and pay attention in class. She's always willing to help and wants you to succeed. Participate in class. Highly recommend. Easy MHR course. 1 group project (sim).",

She is very approachable and interesting to talk to.",

She's just reading her ppt every time and her voice is really small. She spends half of the class time doing iclicker questions, in which I see no point. She also requires to do some stupid simulation.",
