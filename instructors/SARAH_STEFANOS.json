The class spanned a very interesting broad range of race history in America, and I thought the different material that Professor Stefanos chose for class was well thought out.

Lecture slides are posted online, so attendance isn't required unless there is an in class activity. She offers extra credit which can be a huge grade booster. Five homework assignments and two take home essay. Can get by without reading the textbook",

They dragged on and her open-ended questions to the class would result in unclear points. The readings are interesting, but very dense. Thats to be expected, but combined with her lectures, it was difficult.",
