I wish I could have him for next semester, but my schedule won't allow it. If you are concerned about Arabic being a very difficult and intimidating class, take Bilal, as he will make it fun and enjoyable to learn. I learned a lot.",

Not a ton of homework and you don't have to do much outside studying as long as you pay attention in class. One caveat is that the Arab dept is pretty disorganized so the curriculum was all over the place. Make sure you watch Ahlan Amrikii!!!",
