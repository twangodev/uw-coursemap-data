She's always super willing to help out and she will set up times outside of office hours for you if you're struggling. Lectures had a tendency to be confusing at times, but she's always willing to clarify things and she makes sure you understand everything.",

It is a class that is way easier if you attend. Definitely take a class with her if you have a chance. Loved her!",

Tests are a bit tricky, but fine if you do the prob sets. A great class that ties into a lot of other classes and things outside of school.  I bought but never use the book. Highly recommend the class and professor!",

There is no TA so its nice to work with other students instead. Overall, she wasn't my favorite econ prof, but I think she does an OK job with a boring and tough subject.",
