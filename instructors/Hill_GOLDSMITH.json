Only one exam which is 99% from lecture notes & 3 oral presentations.  The TA grades everything except for the final presentation which is peer-graded.He comes across as 'socially detached' but does help when you ask questions.",

Socially awkward. Attendance mandatory because it's a small class. Only reading is APA articles, no textbook. Some videos watched. Powerpoint presentation and paper plus an exam.",
