Dr. Weaver was always so helpful and would re-explain any topic that students asked. He left time at the end of lectures to ask question and before exams he would usually had an extra office hours time.",

His exams were pretty fair and overall I would recommend this prof.",

His lectures were optional and focused more on answering questions than teaching. The class was mostly self-taught , but he was very accessible during office hours which were helpful before quizzes/exams. Recommend!",
