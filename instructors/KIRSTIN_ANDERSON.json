She makes the lectures very engaging and interesting, they feel much shorter than they are. The papers were always assigned 2 weeks before the deadline and the prompts/rubric were very clear and transparent. Exams were not bad at all either.",

Her policy will not even allow laptops in the lecture, which is frankly out of touch. The class might be better with a different prof.",
