He literally copies down his lecture notes on board and whenever we have questions about the stuff regarding whatever we are talking about in the lecture, he expects you to find the answer by yourself. I'd say try not to have him if you dont want to have extra stress that you dont need to have",

When I would ask for help all I would get is \"You need to do the example problems very carefully.\" Incredibly harsh grader, once lost 4 out of 10 points in a homework problem for forgetting to carry a negative from one line to the next. Would not recommend. Ever",
