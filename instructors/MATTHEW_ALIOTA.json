Prof talked about parasites in a human way rather than the robotic manner some science instruction has. Great science prof.",

That being said, the exams are pretty challenging, though they're non-cumulative. The quizzesshort responses are a good grade booster. I liked the class as a whole and would recommend it and him as a professor.",
