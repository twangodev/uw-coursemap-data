Honestly didn't feel like I got a lot out of the class though.",

It shouldn't be hard to make it interesting (talking about cultural vampires, sociology, or psychology) but he finds a way to make them both boring and unclear.  He went over everything we needed to read in class so in retrospect there was no need to read anything.  It might be easy, but no engagement.",
