Yes he is new to teaching the course, but he is still knowledgeable, and quite honestly most of the course is definitions and memorization. The appraisal project I agree is pretty brutal, could use better guidance. Nice guy, good teacher, cares a lot. ",

He was unable to give any insight on the term project because he \"knew as much about the project as we did\". His instructions are so unclear and he was consistently unable to offer any kind of clarity to them. ",

The lectures don't require note-taking, they're only there for your own self-improvement, and even if you're afraid of public speaking he will help create a safe environment to learn.",

Only downside is that he is a tough grader, but also not mean. You have to work for an A but you won't do worse than a B either. I'd still highly recommend him for EPD 275.",
