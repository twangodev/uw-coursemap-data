However, his lectures can be a lot and can often feel like you're hearing someone recite lines from a textbook. Homeworks are hard and take a lot of time. I dropped, but I'd recommend!",

Sometimes he makes silly errors on the board (arithmetic is hard even for math PhDs) but he just laughs it off. The homework is hard, but it prepares you well for the exams which aren't too hard. He gives you a practice exam which shows you the exact format.",
