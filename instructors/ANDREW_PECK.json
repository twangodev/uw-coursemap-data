He grades based on personal opinion rather than real measures. He's the professor who says \"no one gets an A\" even if you do A-quality work. Answers questions with questions. Extremely unclear. BUSYWORK. Should be a 4 credit class.",

The content in his lectures is very interesting for all types of majors, not just digital studies. His TA Meg is the absolute plug, and both are very helpful when it comes to the video project. DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",

Andrew guides and challenges you to take a deep dive into what's meaningful in the world and to yourself. He  demands,and fosters, initiative and creativity. Fantastic course.",

I think he grades too hard for a 200 level class though.  Both exams are essays, which means they are completely subjective.  TA grades everything else though.  Don't take unless completing Digital Studies certificate.",

Honestly, I would recommend this class to non Comm Arts professors because it really made me aware of my digital media tendencies and why we are the way we are online. Exams are super easy, but the projects are a bit tougher!",
