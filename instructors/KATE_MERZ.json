During the course, there are a ton of short readings that you are require to read before discussion and then some short writing assignments in between that are 2-3 pages along with 3 writing projects.",

Don't expect to get grades back quickly. She knows that we have other things going on which makes her very understanding. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a chill professor.",

Definitely was able to make a connection even though it was online! Definitely an easy grader and reasonable with participation. I would strongly recommend taking a class with Professor Merz! It was also an easy A which is nice too!",
