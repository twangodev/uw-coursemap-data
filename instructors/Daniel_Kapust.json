Not only is he super knowledgable but he can explain ideas in ways that undergrads understand and relates theoretical concepts with pop culture and contemporary ideas. Very helpful; he'll answer any question you want to ask him and will make you feel like it's a valid question regardless of how stupid it is. Must-have prof at UW",
