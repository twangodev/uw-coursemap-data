He is responsible and responsive to students' questions and concerns. There are also extra credit assignments at the end which you can use to boost your grade. I recommend Dr. Brown!!",

It's helpful to have some knowledge of history of that region, otherwise places/names can be a bit confusing considering the time span covered. Prof. does have the most AMAZING voice though. Very mellow even though class can drag on for eons.",
