I was so inspired (which is what a good teacher must be able to do-inspire students) that I have integrated his teachings into my life!

His tests are impossible- he goes into insanely specific details. Most students don't score above a 50%, but he does curve his tests which helps. Avoid him if you can.",

Test prep materials: extensive and poorly written articles he posts online. Exams are multiple choice, with up to 10 options & none of them make sense. Good luck, you'll need it.",

He barely uses his slides even in lecture and speaks just out of his head. I scores in the 90's on the first 2 tests in this class with different prof, and failed his test. You have no chance.",

Also, the lab section is self graded so it wasn't too stressful. My only complaint would be that I felt unsure of what would exactly appear on the tests. I would definitely recommend this class",
