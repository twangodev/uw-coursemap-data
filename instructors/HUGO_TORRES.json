He made us work to earn our grades, but he also made sure that students who put forth a sincere effort in the class were rewarded for their hard work.  Furthermore, he was always kind and non-judgmental, two necessary qualities in a foreign language teacher.",

The regular quizzing and homework require students to put in a good amount of work. Its clear that he cares about the success of his students, which is a characteristic rarely found in teachers of intro. classes.",

Hugo communicates concepts with ease and makes himself available when needed. He goes beyond the textbook to aid his lessons, using \"real\" French that one would actually use. Great class. Awesome TA. No complaints.",

Hugo used movies/songs/articles (outside of our textbook) to make French relevant to our daily lives. Participate and speak up! Hugo is approachable and friendly. I would definitely take another course with him.",

Very passionate about the language & culture, absolutely will teach you as much as you want to learn beyond the course material, if you show the interest.  Not easy, but fair - expects you to put work in, but makes sure work is rewarding.  Had much appreciated originality when it came to lesson plans as well.",

He oversimplifies it, and occasionally forgets to mention the smaller subtle details, much unlike other French professors I have met in introductory courses (101).",
