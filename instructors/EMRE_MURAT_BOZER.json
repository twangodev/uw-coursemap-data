In a lot of classes this is not the case for me as i'm always checking how much time is left.\n\nHe also is very nice and will answer any questions. Very good at explaining topics and seems very proficient in Japanese.\n\nCan grade late though\n\n",

Sometimes I think he talks a little too fast in Japanese, but otherwise his lectures are great. The class itself requires a good amount of studying, and there is pre and post class hw every day. Get behind and you wont pass",
