She came to mind because I'm now retaking courses for better exposure to the same material she &quot;taught.&quot; My A wasn't enough, I wanted to learn the material. Is she knowledgeable? Yes. But she's not a great teacher of what she knows, and her tone can be borderline unprofessional.",

However, she corners you into an idea, thus draining any sense of creativity you may possess, and then gives you a bad grade. Tests are reasonably difficult and there is zero organization in this course, but Dr. V is very accessible via Skype and knows she is doing.",
