Although 140 is listed as an elementary class, I felt thoroughly challenged by the readings and the final analytical paper, so I will say that her class takes effort. Overall, I had a great experience with Dr. Anja!",

The entire course is reading the books and listening to her talk about profound, incredible insights she has about life that relates to book and she's a dawg; very nice lady, passionate, and funny. You don't need to read. Two papers, a creative project, and a test, all easy af. Easiest and most interesting class I've taken.",
