Seems to jump around and I definitely pick up on anxiety. Wish powerpoints were available BEFORE class to write notes on. Dig the pre-class music!",

Tests were not that bad though and she was willing to help.  She is also very knowledgeable in the topic which can be a plus or minus.",

She burned through the Powerpoint slides and was not willing to provide them for printout before the lecture.  I relied heavily on the book to get a good grade.",

She seemed nervous and her powerpoints were pretty scrambled and unclear, plus she didn't really give us a good idea of what was going to be on the tests. I didn't like her lecturing, but her tests were really easy, fair and straightforward.",
