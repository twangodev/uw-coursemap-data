She is also always willing to help out and allows re-writes on the papers. If you keep up with the slides, there is no reason for you not to do well! Also, it is really interesting material!",

Prof. Kroiz gets very off tangent a lot of the time and often talks about paintings that we don't need to know anything about, which is just confusing. Most of what she says can be found in the text book. But the exams aren't too bad and she basically tells you what you need to study.",
