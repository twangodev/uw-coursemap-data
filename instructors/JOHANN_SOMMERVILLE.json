The class seems like a lot of work initially, but I quickly realized the textbook reading is completely unnecessary because you're tested only on what's on the PowerPoint. You're assigned a lot of reading, but it's completely optional. I wouldn't recommend buying the textbook. The class is very lecture heavy, the class is basically Sommerville talking at you on stage for an hour and fifteen minutes. He gives a ton of information but it's very simple to figure out what you will be tested on because he spends a disproportionate amount of time on those topics. Two exams, 10% MC and 90% essay, graded by the TA, and he is relatively lenient so it isn't hard to do well. You barely even have to know dates or most unimportant names. Final is a 5 day take home final with just 2 essay questions  Overall, I liked the material, Sommerville's British accent makes it interesting and he makes a witty joke maybe once a lecture. You should take his class!",
