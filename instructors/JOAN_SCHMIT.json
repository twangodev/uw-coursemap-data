One thing to just know about this class though is that material seems very easy to grasp in class, however go to office hours with Joan and she will show you how to apply it in real life. Applying the material is what the exams test, so go to see her it's well worth your time.",

I personally didn't know much about Risk Management & Insurance entering the course, but she really captured my interest in it. Tests are fair but not easy. I attended almost every lecture and will most likely finish with a B.",

If you want a class that takes no work to get an A, this class isn't for you and this school isn't for you. If you want to put the time in (1 hr outside classweek) you will learn more than you could have imagined.",

She really enjoys teaching and the material she teaches. Be sure to go to class, since there is no required book to supplement the lectures. A+!",

Had to figure out stuff I was confused on on my own because she doesn't answer your question well if you ask her or she makes you ask it in front of 250 people and try to make you figure it out. Tests are tough, the material would be good to know but she rambles on about concepts that SHOULD be easy.",

She has many available office hours but if you ask her a question, she will throw it right back at you and make you feel uncomfortable if you have no idea.
