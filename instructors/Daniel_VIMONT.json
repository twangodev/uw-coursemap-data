First off, if you have the choice take ATM 101 and not 100 because the discussion is 25% of your entire grade and all you have to do is attend discussion and your discussion grade will be 100%. It also really prepares you for the tests. The homework and review sheets really help you.  This class is an EASY AB",

It wasn't too easy, but if you do the work and study its not hard to get a good grade. Its also very interesting, definentely suggest taking it. Anyone who says he's bad is just stupid.",

Going to lecture definitely helps you understand material better and if you go to his office hours he is VERY helpful.
