The class enabled me to relate folklore to my daily life + have a better understanding of the communities I am a part of. There were a few papers and a final project due, but it's definitely manageable + enjoyable. Would 100% take it with him again :D",

The lectures aren't mandatory but there are pop questions that are either graded or for extra credit. The discussions are mandatory. This class has lots of papers but are very easy to get full credit. Definitely recommend if you want an easy comm b class. ",

The content is super easy and you only really need to attend lecture a majority of the time, the main content is the first few weeks then everything is building upon it. 5 main papers/projects that aren't too hard, but don't wait to finish them. Easy graders.",

There are about 5 papers that you write throughout the semester, but he was the only professor I have had that has even mentioned the importance of mental health, so if you ever needed an extension for whatever reason, he allowed it. Passionate about what he is teaching.",
