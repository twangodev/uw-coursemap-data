Dave cares about us students.  Video lectures before class, in class problems instead of lectures.  Asked for feedback after first month, AND LISTENED.  A must take.  David Anderson for president!",

Exams are rough, but his lectures and notes are VERY helpful, & is VERY willing to help out if you visit him in office hours. This is one of those classes that anyone can get an A if you put in the effort. Recommend!",

He knows his stuff, teaches well, is pleasant, is very willing to help by email and office hours, and doesn't throw curve balls on exams. His class is hard, but if you go to lecture and do your homework, you can earn an A. Very down to earth and intelligent guy- a great asset at UW-Madison!",
