If you ask a question & try to interpret, he will reject you instead of leading you in the right direction like a good teacher would do. Don't be late & read the text.

Tips: go to lecture, go to review sessions, and do the optional paper. It is possible to do well in his class. He forces you think to think whether you want to or not!",

For the novels section he spends 4 days on each one when he only has about 15 minutes worth of intelligent things to say on the novel in total.  That leaves 185 minutes per novel of repeating what he already said OVER AND OVER.  Write the optional paper if you do take it.",
