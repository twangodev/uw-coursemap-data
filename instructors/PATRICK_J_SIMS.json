It was part of my FIG and I was actually scared because I had never been been a part of theater before; however, the class is amazingly well taught by Patrick and the TA's. If you need an ethnic studies class, this is the class to take. It is enjoyable while getting to learn relevant material.",

Theatre 250 was great and challenging and 357 theatre for social and cultural awareness has been one of the best courses I have ever taken at madison. You will be able to use what you learned from him in your real life.",

He pushes you to your limits as an actor but is there for you whenever you have problems.  The only downside was that since he is a professional actor he was often out of town doing a show during our semester and we had a substitute teacher every Friday",
