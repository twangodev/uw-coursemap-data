It was part of my FIG and I was actually scared because I had never been been a part of theater before; however, the class is amazingly well taught by Patrick and the TA's. If you need an ethnic studies class, this is the class to take. It is enjoyable while getting to learn relevant material.",

Theatre 250 was great and challenging and 357 theatre for social and cultural awareness has been one of the best courses I have ever taken at madison.

He pushes you to your limits as an actor but is there for you whenever you have problems.
