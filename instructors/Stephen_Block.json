Block makes lecture interesting by throwing in interesting stories and nerdy jokes on a regular basis. Overall I would be glad to take a class with him again.",

He gave us a generous curve.",

Dr. Block is trying to explain everything well, and he generally did it. Just something is unclear. All faculty are accessible outside of class on Piazza. Be prepared to use 10 hour per week on this courses.",

He relies heavily on pre-class work and tends to not explain some topics as well as he should. The tests are hard and averages are generally around 58-60%. There's a lot of work outside of class too.",
