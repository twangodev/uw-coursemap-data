Only basic examples were given in class, which did not at all match the discussion quizzes or homework, which was frustrating. There was also a huge disconnect with the TA's; more than once my TA told us to put a question mark because he didn't know how to answer a worksheet question.",

The fact that I paid for such unhelpful lectures and discussions makes me depressed",
