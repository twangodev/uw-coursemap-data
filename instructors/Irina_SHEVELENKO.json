In addition, this class may pose a challenge for students who are not familiar with the language (names, patronymics, etc). You have 3 papers, 3 exams, and other assignments. Easy class for a Comm-B, but you need to read. Lectures are somewhat useless.",

Reading is important to do well on the exams, but if you take the Comm-B section you can still get mediocre grades on exams and get a good grade with the writing you have to do for your extra section.
