She knows what she's talking about and how to lecture a class with this much material. She also makes it fun.  No, it's not easy but come on, it's neuroscience. If you try you'll do fine. 5 exams, 100 points for online quizzes, and EC.",

She now has ten quizzes which are an easy 100 points and from what other people have said, she's cut back quite a bit on the material. Still not an easy class, but it's definitely possible to get an A. She also offers extra credit and is much more flexible than some other professors I've had.",
