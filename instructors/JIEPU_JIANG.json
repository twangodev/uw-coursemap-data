Very easy class to learn new tech tools without having the stress of STEM class teaching styles. Prof is very accessible and well versed in the subject, and he's very understanding with his students. A good one!",

If you want to learn more about the materials, he could provide much more information and help. If you just want to pass the course, it's quite easy to pass! Highly recommend!!!",
