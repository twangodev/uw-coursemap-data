Also, you can't go back over a question after you answer it. All of that would be infuriating but understandable. But this prof has the GALL to say she doesn't have tests, massive lie",

The expectations of the the course are very clear. Each week: one discussion, 300 word writing assignment, activity and quiz. No exams. Highly suggest taking marine biology with her if you can! You won't regret it!!",
