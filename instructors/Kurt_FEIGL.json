Professor Feigl was a terrible lecturer who went WAY too fast (1 slide every 10-30 seconds) and the clicker questions often require knowledge of which he has not taught. The course itself is very reading extensive (up to 90 pages per week). Also, the labs are graded much too harshly. DO NOT TAKE THIS AS A FILLER!",
