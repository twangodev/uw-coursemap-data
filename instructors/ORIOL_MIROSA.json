The class material was difficult, but I felt like more guidance with papers and more discussions around contemporary issues would've helped. Overall great professor!!!",

He is incredibly helpful when it comes to answering questions about material or discussing paper topics, he really wants you to do well in the class. Only having quizzes and papers makes it easy to do well. Highly recommended for 475",

Material was fascinating and well-presented, time was made for discussion. Overall, I'm glad I took the class with Oriol.",
