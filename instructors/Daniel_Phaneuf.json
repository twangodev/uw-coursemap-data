In the midst of COVID, we are expected to make every class at 8 am. Pop quizzes are given for attendance with NO drops or makeups. One 2 pt quiz can be drastic to your grade. Awfully designed course by the chair himself",

If you do not show up you won't be able to access the participation activities or small pop quizzes, so you almost have to go. The class is only out of 100 points so missing one quiz hurts you. But other than that his grading is super light and fair so assignments aren't hard",

His lectures are sometimes dry, he assigns a lot of readings and sometimes has short quizzes during class. However, take notes, listen to his lectures, and they're not hard.

Bring a snack or drink to stay awake but make sure to come or you'll fall behind fast.
