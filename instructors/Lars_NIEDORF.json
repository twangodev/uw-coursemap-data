His lecture style is amazing for first semester freshman coming from high school since he uploads blank and filled in copies of his notes as well as lecture recordings. He is very understandable and is always willing to answer your doubts mid-lecture. Def recommend!!",

Gave me extensions and checked in on me when I was going through serious sh*t (censored for RMP site standards). He's pretty good for how new he is and provided lecture recordings (if you are like me and fear the stench of CS freshmen).",
