A particularly endearing quirk is he thinks of mechanisms in Tree Phys as cartoons, which works well to clearly explain complex ideas. He teaches through case study which you will either love or hate. ",

His exam was probably the most fair exam I've ever taken at this university, so if you study the power points and discussion materials you should be fine! Great prof",

Although some people might find him a bit arrogant at times, to me I thought he truly wanted students to understand/learn the material.
