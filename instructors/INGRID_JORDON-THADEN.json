Most importantly, I hate the fact that we're graded based on only the labs and quizzes. But to her defense, there were 14 quizzes in class, if you mess up in one, you can make it up in other quizzes. She is also very considerate of students' hardships.",

Her lectures were mediocre at best, and you only have to take notes off the lecture slides to get the content. The lectures are straight from the book, so it is not necessary to do both.",
