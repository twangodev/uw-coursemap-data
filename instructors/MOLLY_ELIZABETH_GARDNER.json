She is super helpful, really cares about her students, and she's funny. If you're a philosophy major, this is a pretty easy A. If you're not, you can still get an A, especially if you go talk to her a lot. Side note: she teaches at UNC now. ",

The papers and quizzes did require thought, so it wasn't a blow off class. But Molly was ALWAYS there to help her students. Very caring, highly recommend any class with her. She is helpful and always available. Goes above and beyond to help.",
