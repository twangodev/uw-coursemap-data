His exams are straightforward questions that, if you understand the mechanics of the homework, will not give you trouble. I have really enjoyed his lecture style, and he is very straightforward/ doesn't make the coursework more complicated than it has to be. Great class",

I'm taking Law and Econ with him and he is so passionate about the course material which makes the lectures engaging and useful. Exams aren't easy but they are very fair. Can't recommend this class/professor enough!",

The exams were taken online and were open note but they are really difficult so it is hard to get a good grade on them. No attendance taken but discussions were extremely helpful. He posts recordings of the lecture + notes. ",
