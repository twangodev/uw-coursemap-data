His prezis are confusing and studying for the midterm and final was not the most productive process due to how disorganized his ideas/slides were.  Overall, he's a decent guy, just not a great professor.",

A lot of what he addresses is super abstract, so be prepared. Exams were easy, quizzes were tough. His lecture slides are kind of crazy genius confusing, but it's all part of the charm.",

Actually not even powerpoints.. prezis.. like seriously dude? Nice guy though.  This class has been no help. Heard the fall semester class is really good with a different professor.",
