Rogers has crazy high standards and morphed the syllabus to have 2 midterms, a presentation, paper proposal, and final paper for 3 weeks. Had a four part MTE after 1 week of class that was to be completed in an hour. Yikes. Very nice & approachable, means well, but the rigor and her standards take away from course",
