She didn't try to make the class any harder than it needed to be, and also was very clear on what was expected of assignments with many reminders of when things were due. No quizzes or exams, which made the class very low-stress. Very accessible outside of class and really wants her students to do well!",

She knows what she's talking about but makes it harder for students to take the time to grasp the subjects before she moves on to the next idea. If you don't do almost all the reading before class you'll be behind.",
