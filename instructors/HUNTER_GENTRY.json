There is not much reading, one article a week, because you focus on it for the whole week, but they can be long. Very discussion-based class. 2 major papers to write, grades hard, but gives amazing feedback",

Two papers and participation determine your grade, but I prefer it that way as there is no busy work. ",

The structure for the class is you read philosophy papers every week (10+ pages each), then he lectures about them. Your grade is based on mandatory participation in discussion sections and 2 papers. Overall, he is a good professor and grades fairly.",
