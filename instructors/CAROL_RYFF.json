Often does not allow time for students to write down any of her powerpoint slides. Waking up at 8 am to struggle to take notes because she reads off slides is not worth it. ",

One big term paper due for the class that I would recommend starting earlier than later, but there's a lot of freedom in topics for the paper, so it's not bad. She's very enthusiastic about her work and I recommend this class.",

Read the book, she asks tests questions on stuff she doesn't cover in lecture. Tests are 80 questions, not impossible if you do the reading. One 10 page term paper and she grades very fairly!
