Email responses are super fast, turnaround on papers was lightning speed, and she was super flexible with students. She is one of those professors who is open to new ideas, too, so she won't judge you if you share an answer with the class that is either wrong or wasn't what she expected.",

The rubric for the final project was given out after most people had completed it which is frustrated because it was video project. She a big too carefree.  Nice lady though.",

There is no organization to the class: changed reading schedules, work on a final project she hadn't entirely created yet. Also her lectures are very confusing. Everything feels like a tangent and its hard to know what's important. At the very least it was easy.",

The final project was a joke because it's an online assignment where we make a website.  Lady, this is an English class.",

It's obvious she cares about the well being of her students as she would always ask to make sure we weren't overwhelmed with the course load or any deadlines.",

While I will leave the class with a deeper appreciation of comics, I don't exactly think I learned too much, fomrally. I wish prof. Valenza had been a little more pedagogical. Most of the class was just &quot;book club&quot; style discussion. Would still recommend.",
