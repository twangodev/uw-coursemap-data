Class is very reading-heavy, some of which are hard, but since class discussions are centered around the readings, he ensures you understand and know the material. Recommend!!",

First two writing assignments make up most of your grade. If you struggle with one, it's hard to recover. No extra credit and assignment instructions were unclear, which added to the difficulty. ",
