Just be good at lecture memorization and you should ace the multiple choice exams.  Apart from that, the class is super insightful, and has real -world applications.  Discussion is kind of useless, and written assignments are easy but time-consuming.",

Reading the textbook helps a lot because she doesn't post up lecture slides and has lots of information per slide. Homework assignments are doable but citing sources is crucial.",
