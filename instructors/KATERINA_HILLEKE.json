She's very passionate about chemistry which is nice to see, but I don't think she quite had a grip on how to put together exams as they were extremely long and difficult compared to other chem 104 classes. Overall if you study hard and do the homework her class is difficult but passable.",

You can tell she has a lot of chemistry knowledge but it creates a little bit of a disconnect with her students.

She has a solid understanding of the material she's teaching, and is very accessible to ask questions or clarify something in lecture or office hours. She points out what you should remember, and her exams are not overly difficult- just make sure to study!",

She does a LOT of tophat questions (takes up the majority of lecture) and doesn't do a very thorough job of going through concepts. Exams are semi-difficult but if you study hard, you'll do fine.",
