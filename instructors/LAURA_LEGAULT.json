Following rules are important but lets just say if you were holding onto a ledge for dear life, she would be the one to watch you and not lend a hand when you REALLY need it.  No empathy from her.

Hobbes (Prof. Legault) is an amazing instructor - I had no previous CS experience going into this class and I feel pretty comfortable coding basic programs in Java now. Her lectures are organized and she codes along with you in class, which I found to be really, really helpful. 302 is challenging but fun - take this class!",
