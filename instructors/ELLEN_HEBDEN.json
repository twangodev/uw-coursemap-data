Every lecture she does is about something really interesting that you wouldn't think to learn about, and the projects are all a lot of fun. She also has a ton of really interesting personal stories.",

I know the majority of my class chose to take a second semester with her, and if my schedule allows I will be doing the same. Take her class!!",

Grade was half attendance, half a presentation based on a reading. Weekly posting based on readings (Super easy to do without reading). Midterm was a take home paper and final was a paper about anything. Took for honors",
