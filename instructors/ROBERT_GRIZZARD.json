I was initially worried by his alternative lecture style, but found it to be much more productive (at least for me) as the semester continued. Every day we either start with a short lecture and move into work time on worksheets he'll hand out or go straight to work time. Weekly homework/quizzes, manageable exams.",

Instead of having lecture/discussion, you have 5 lectures a week with him at each one with a class of about 80 students. He lectures the first part of class and then gives you a worksheet for the rest of class. The worksheets are good for practice problems to practice before exams",

Also important to note, he doesn't put anything up online, so if you skip, you better already know calc.",

He's brilliant, but he kinda speaks math and not usual English. He's very confusing and I got way more sense out of his TA person than him. I got a 5 on the AP test, but only a B in the class",
