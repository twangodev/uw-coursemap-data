Cant teach, cant answer questions, is very rude in lecture, and has horrible handwriting. I'd recommend only going to class to turn in homework since he cant teach anyways so no point in even attending.",

He also writes all of his notes on the board so its not hard to keep up during lecture. Plus, nearly all of the exam problems are from homework problems. LOVE this guy.",
