The slides are so structured and easy to follow. It has exams but they are not that difficult as long as you pay attention to class and read through textbooks.Would highly recommend",

Also the class was a power lec & sometimes painful to sit through--it was in Van Vleck tho. The exams were harder, but good amount of assignments to get an an AB or A. ",

Tophat attendance questions-which I actually like because it really forces you to learn the material because memorization is crucial for the exams. So sweet, interesting concepts, and she clearly seems happy to be doing what she is doing. All assignments are easy. Highly recommend! ",

Reading the textbook is very helpful, but you can get by without it if you do the homework.",
