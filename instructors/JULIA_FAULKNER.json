I know that I'll walk away from UW-Madison being a fine singer, and a wonderful human being because of her.  She is so much more than a teacher: she's a friend, confidante, role model, and basically all things good.  I'll never be able to thank her enough for what she does.",

Also, she shows up when you search for her on iTunes.",
