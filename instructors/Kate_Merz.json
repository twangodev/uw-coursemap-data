I was in her English 100 class and I was very happy with my grade and the way she cared about how her students were feeling even outside of class. She was very respectful and was very understanding. Highly recommend!!",

During the course, there are a ton of short readings that you are require to read before discussion and then some short writing assignments in between that are 2-3 pages along with 3 writing projects.",

Don't expect to get grades back quickly. She knows that we have other things going on which makes her very understanding. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a chill professor.",

Definitely was able to make a connection even though it was online! Definitely an easy grader and reasonable with participation. I would strongly recommend taking a class with Professor Merz! It was also an easy A which is nice too!",
