Make sure to buy the textbook and all of the exams and quizzes are outlined clearly in the syllabus. No surprises. Show up to class and don't use your phone and you are set. I recommend her to anyone looking to take 102.",

If you do all the work, you won't have to kill yourself studying for exams, just review will do",
