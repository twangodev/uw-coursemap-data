The essays are open-ended and therefore not difficult if you put in effort. There is a lot of reading and it can be tough to get through and understand as it's old stuff. ",

He was easy to work with and made the whole class feel involved. This class had a lot of reading, but he gives that disclaimer at the beginning of the semester. Overall a great course.",
