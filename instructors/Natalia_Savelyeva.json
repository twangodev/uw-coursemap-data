No in person exams, 1 small assignment a week that would never take me more than 30 mins. Shes sweet and would let me leave class early when I had chem exams after. Sometimes the long lectures were boring but if ur interested in soc they're not bad.",

There are weekly quizzes or essay (rarely essays). Midterm tests, essays, final test, and final essay are all worth 70% of your grade.",

There are two exams which are very random questions. If you love writing about sociology, I'd recommend for Comm B, TAs are awesome too, but there are easier Comm B courses.",

If you ask her a question about these, she will refuse to give you an answer. She rambles a lot, and lectures are boring. She also says \"um\" a lot... so if that's something that bothers you, heads up. Hope this review helped!!",
