He adds a ton of math to the course that other econ professors do not. I only took Calc 1 and I felt that I was at a disadvantage to students who had taken Calc 3.

I don't want you to think that he will wreck your GPA or eliminate all of your free time; that simply isn't the case. He can also take *constructive* criticism, unlike a lot of profs at UW.",
