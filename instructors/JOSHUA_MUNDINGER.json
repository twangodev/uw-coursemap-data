It was a very information-dense class and we went quickly at times, but he published written lecture notes which you could look at after class. All in all, amazing professor who loves his craft. Would take any class with him",

The lectures and homeworks are all in-depth proof based but the tests have some computational problems (which he doesn't directly teach). His grading is very rigorous. Overall, if you a hardcore lin alg course, go with him, otherwise, go with someone else.",

He spiced things up at times with the linear algebra cookbook. He was very clear and the exams were well-constructed. However, for those genuinely passionate about math, I'd recommend 341 over this class, as it was quite basic.",
