I've never felt so motivated to work as hard as I did for this class, and it paid off. Try hard and you will succeed! Also make sure to take advantage of his office hours--he's extremely approachable.",

In class quizzes sometime seem to test on the smallest things, but luckily don't count for too much of the grade. Exams are hard due to time, but really get you thinking. I now love PoliSci because of him!",
