There are better psych capstones to choose from. ",

Assignments were two papers, two presentations (1 individual, 1 group), and participation. Probably wouldn't be a great class for someone who struggles with speaking in discussion, but she was accommodating to the best of her ability.  ",

Does not have a TA or anyone to check her grading and so she can get away with anything she wants. Extremely opinionated and will mark you wrong or out you in the class if she disagrees even if its your opinion.",

Not lecture-heavy and no exams.",

Lots of group projects and presentations plus a couple lit reviews. She also looks for specific things for you to mention when she grades. Overall, she's okay but not the best at teaching the material",

No exams, but quite a few projects and weekly assignments.",
