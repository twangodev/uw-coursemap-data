For 302, he expects a solid calc base, so brush up on that before starting the class. Don't follow all his steps when he's showing you formulas- you'll just confuse yourself. Just make sure you get the final formula.",

He teaches you the background of an issue and then connects it to current events which can be very interesting if you care about the economy around you. Just do the problems sets, earlier exams and in class exercises and you should know the material. Study guide is useless but book was helpful",
