Definitely show up to the lectures because they really help supplement the long readings you are asked to do. Discussion is okay but I think its the TA that makes or breaks it. If you put in the work you'll be fine.",

Lectures were based off of the theories proposed in weekly intense readings, and sometimes were incredibly boring (going over the history of paper...). Lucas is eloquent and easy to follow + take notes. Discussion sections were helpful in dissecting readings.",

He's very clear and knowledgeable, and showed our discussion group that he cared about and acknowledged our hard work throughout our projects. Labs are insufferable (partially due to TA, partially due to 9am) but the pacing kept me on track and content we were taught to produce was really rewarding in the end.",

The course was VERY reading heavy (one intense reading assigned per lecture) and lectures were spent breaking down readings that were assigned for that day. I was disappointed because none of the ideas felt like his own, just reflections of readings. Ok class, just not my style.",

The way he articulates information is very useful and makes it easy to take detailed notes. I didn't initially care about the topic, but left loving it because of his demeanor and support.

He made class overly complicated, was not present and did not have J202 organized to work online until halfway through the semester. Unfortunately, he seemed nice with what little we heard from him, but I just didn't hear much from him.",

He also tends to go on tangents which detracts from the main content of lectures. I found essays very difficult to write because of this. Also, the amount of reading is absurd.",

Additionally, he refuses to use canvas so you have no clue where your grade stands until the class is over. He cold calls too. Two blue book exams and a final paper that is 6-8 pages too. Avoid him",

At the beginning of the semester I was intimidated by the amount of reading per week, but you get used to it and he does a great job explaining them in lecture. Lecture is mandatory, but it's fun and interesting 90% of the time. Midterm and final are blue book exams. I would recommend this course!",

This class did have a lot of reading but Graves knows how to lead a discussion and I never felt bored in the power lectures.
