She is incapable of creating a comprehensive lecture narrative, goes on a bunch of tangents, and manages to make a really interesting topic incredibly boring. Discussions are the only part of class that aren't a total waste of time. I'm lucky I've read Machiavelli before but if you haven't you'd be lost.",

The tests are manageable, but the papers are graded harshly. There are also very few grades in the class, and the only reason to attend lecture is because she takes attendance.

Also treats the lecture like a discussion except there are 150 of us. Frustrating class to sit through",
