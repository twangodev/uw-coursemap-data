The tests are impossible and I got a 50% on every one but ended with an A/B because he curves and gives so many opportunities to get your grade up. He gave us a 5% increase for doing a practice test. Also dropped our worst midterm. So funny i hate Econ and am bad at it but he made it okay",

I learned most of the material through the Mankiw text and my TA, as his lecture is very fast paced and hard to follow. Overall, not an easy dive into economics, but doable.",

His teaching is a lot more theory-synthesis-based so you don't need to be particularly good at math, yet logic will help a lot. He is kind of a crackhead in lecture but it helps in grasping the information. Text is the base for problem sets but is not bad.",
