He uses powerpoints with basic bullet points that he also posts on the class website, but it's important to go to lecture and take notes so you know details. He makes lecture very interesting even when it's boring and is super caring. You have to work hard for an A",

He does what he needs to do to expose students to the introductory journalism concepts. His lecture slides were somewhat disjointed, but he was able to communicate what he needed to. Should be an easy A/AB.",
