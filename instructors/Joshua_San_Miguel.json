If you take this course, without any prior architecture understanding, it would obviously be hard, that is not the professor's mistake. It is not an easy course but one will surely get a chance to learn a lot. I would highly recommend the professor and the course",

For the ppl that are complaining about the level of difficulty of the course, yes it is a hard course, but that is the way it has always been at UW. So don't blame prof for teaching a difficult course which he has minimal control over the content. Although I do think we would benefit from more lecture",

The weekly quiz is to test if you watched the videos which actually means he will give you a 2+ hrs of videos and pick extremely specific details and ask if you remember them. The program is one of the hardest I've done in college which isn't bad if i didn't have to do all the other crap!!!!",
