He starts each class writing the intended topics on the board and proceeds to present them. He engages the class occasionally for questions. I found it better to listen than write what he writes on the board. Mandatory Disc.",

But if you read the book and go to lecture and discussion, you should do well. There are only 2 papers and 2 quizes with a midterm and a final so everything counts. Make sure to get help when needed.",

He has a tendency to go over things and talk them to death, but that may work to your advantage for papers and essay questions on exams. Take his class!",
