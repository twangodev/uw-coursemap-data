He really cares about his students' success and you can tell his goal is NOT to just teach for the sake of teaching (keep us mindlessly busy memorizing facts/definitions) but to teach us relevant materials. By far one of the best professors i've ever had. He also gives good life advice in class so take it with him! ",
