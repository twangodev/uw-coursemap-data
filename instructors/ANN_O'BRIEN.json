She goes above and beyond for the accounting program and really tries to teach in a way that avoids boring powerpoint lecture slides. She strives to have the students learn to teach different systems to themselves, which will be helpful in the long run, but she is still available for questions.",

Employs a good blend of textbook material and experiential learning through software projects.  She's very clear about interrelationships of topics, and IT & accounting in general.  Provides a lot of opportunities to learn.  Good experience!",
