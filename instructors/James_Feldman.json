There were a lot of readings for the class but none of the readings felt disconnected from the material. Overall, I really enjoyed the amount of discussion that was offered within the lecture and discussions about the readings that we had assigned outside of class. ",

Lengthy reading at times, but necessary for background. Though it was a big lecture, he knew nearly all of our names and created an environment for discussion. He is very approachable and ready to help his students succeed.",
