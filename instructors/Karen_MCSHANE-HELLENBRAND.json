Would not recommend taking her, find someone else in the department",

She says the class is for people of all skill levels, but she is quite tough on those that don't get things right away. Do your best and don't take yourself too seriously and you'll get a lot out of this class.",

Instead of encourage dancing, she let my shy classmate with so much frustration and the feeling he will never would be able to dance socially. It was a 1 credit class!
