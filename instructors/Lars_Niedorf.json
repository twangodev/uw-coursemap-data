He provides templates for notes, which makes learning the material easier, and the HW is easy if you don't procrastinate. The tests are a huge portion of your grade, however, and the MCs are usually a bit tricky.",

Lectures get a little boring because unlike most math classes he doesn't ever pause for students to try an example on there own but he is a good teacher. Tests are very hard though, partial credit was strict, and the multiple choice questions weirdly abstract. Lectures are recorded which is nice.",

His lecture style is amazing for first semester freshman coming from high school since he uploads blank and filled in copies of his notes as well as lecture recordings. He is very understandable and is always willing to answer your doubts mid-lecture. Def recommend!!",

Gave me extensions and checked in on me when I was going through serious sh*t (censored for RMP site standards). He's pretty good for how new he is and provided lecture recordings (if you are like me and fear the stench of CS freshmen).",
