The class is hard (a lot harder than 301) and so are the exams, but he explains the content well and is always available to meet and help you (he cares a lot). The class is curved a lot (don't get discouraged by the syllabus). I would def take Griffith again!!1",

I'll admit he talks SO fast, but if you record his lectures and listen to them at your own pace (and I like to transcribe them), he explains things really clearly. Plus, he shows us example problems that teach us things the textbook may have left out. He goes over quizzes/exams, which is very caring. Very accessible for help.",
