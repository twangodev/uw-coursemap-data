Truly brilliant, great lecturer, very interested in what his students are doing and always willing to help. This man had lunch with his Chad section every week just to chat and see what we were up to. Lots of work/reading, but worth your time. TAKE A CLASS WITH SURI.",

It's an easy class to get an A in if you do all the readings and go to all the lectures. Tests are take home, there is one paper, and class partic. is vital. Probably one of the most pertinant classes at UW-Mad today.",
