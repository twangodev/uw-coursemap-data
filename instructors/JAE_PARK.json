The group project is the biggest waste of time as you don't learn anything in it, you are just trying to get it done. I spent way too many hours on this class for it only being 3 credits.",

He has a lot of knowledge, wisdom, and world travels that he likes to share with the class. He grades very easily and is more focused on what you can take away from the class. Little guidance howeve",
