Assignments were not needlessly tedious and always left me with a better understanding of the course material. Pay attention and you will do just fine.",

Strongly recommend this course to anybody.",

The lectures were to the point and the homework's and class projects were very practical and focused on the fundamentals. There wasn't a question he couldn't answer. Great professor!",
