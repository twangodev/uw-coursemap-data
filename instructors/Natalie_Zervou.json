Every week you write 200 words to explain a whole week of lecture and then the grader marks you off so much if you miss anything, when its impossible to add it all. Natalie is not accommodating and does not care what grade you get. Very liberal class.",

As long as you take notes during lec and review a tiny bit before quizzes you'll get an A. The papers are 2 pages each, and you have to go to a dance performance to write them. Overall, very enjoyable class. Natalie is the sweetest!",

She outlines all quizzes in a study guide that, if you do the study guide, you can easily achieve an A on. Super fun and energetic to have, and studio days were a great way to get out of the classroom.",
