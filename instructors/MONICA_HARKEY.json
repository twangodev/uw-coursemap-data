Provides plenty of material. Rarely, if ever, available to meet with students in person. I get the impression her in-person classes are far more rewarding than an online class.",

She is the most fun teacher I've had thus far and suspect she will be at the end of my college career.  As if enthusiasm wasn't enough, exams are easy and she offers extra credit that almost guarantees an A.  Take the class with Monica.",

It's obvious that she wants her students to do the best they can and is very available/approachable. If you don't put in any time and fail to study you may get a shock on your exams, but if you put in even a small effort it's be an easy A. My favorite class so far!",

She will do anything from dancing to doing balloon demonstrations to get you excited about the weather.  Her passion for weather is contagious and makes the class fun! Monica is willing to go out of her way to help you understand the material.",

Can be unclear during lecture -- talks about a lot that isn't relevant to the course, but is very helpful and nice. Not an easy A if you're just taking it for the science credit.",
