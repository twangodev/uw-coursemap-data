He provided countless opportunities for students to receive extra credit and was very accomodating. He understands that O Chem is a challenging course and did a great job making the material more approachable. I will forever be in debt to Prof. Boydston.",

He is so understanding and updated his syllabus to reflect this crazy time during the pandemic. He had super accessible office hours and truly wanted to help his students. There were three exams, along with an optional fourth retake exam. Highly recommend!!",

He doesn't try to be tricky on exams and is very straight forward. Overall, he is a great professor! If you have the chance to take one of his classes, do it!",

There are three exams worth 15% and a final worth 20%. The exams are take-home (but very in-depth questions), but he allows you to retake one of the three to replace your worst one. A very smart and forgiving guy.",

I struggled a lot in the beginning, but he was always available during and outside class including office hours. He tries his best to provide supports based on students' needs. I would definitely take his class again, and he genuinely cares about his students.",

Class moves fast but Boydston is a clear lecturer and fair with grading. He wants students to do well and holds productive office hours sessions. Helps to have a good TA and a strong background in chemistry from high school.",
