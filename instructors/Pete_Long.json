He gives great advice on \"real-world\" situations, too!",

The grading is super easy, workload is very manageable and it is essentially just one semester-long group project with a few quizzes sprinkled in. He gives study guides for the quizzes that tell you exactly what will be on it. You won't need to do more than 1 or 2 hrs of out of class work each week.",
