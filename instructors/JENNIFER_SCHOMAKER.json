She lets you know exactly what mechanisms and reactions you have to know for the exams. Exams are extremely fair. Attend her review sessions because she usually slips some exam questions. If Jen is an option , take her!",

However, during the \"lecture break\" she is more than willing to answer anything you missed. You have to work hard, but she is a great teacher. No reason to be nervous for this class, the resources are there to do well",
