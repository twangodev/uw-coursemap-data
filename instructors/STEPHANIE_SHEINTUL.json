You'll never be surprised during an exam because everything is given beforehand. ",

Other than that, you have to do a one page case study review on 5 out of 7 of the case studies. Participation matters in discussion sections. ",

Although it's a 4-credit Comm B class, and thanks to the reviews here, I can attest that Steph is like what others say here. I didn't do the readings on time (googled summaries online) but it is fascinating tbh. Would  to learn from her again.",

Since she lectures on pretty controversial topics, you would think she was input her own opinion in the material, but she stays neutral! Great comm B class that ISNT boring. 2 short papers and one long 8-10pg paper. This class really makes you challenge your own opinions, I really enjoyed it.",
