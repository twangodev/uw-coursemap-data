Your lowest exam grade is dropped, meaning you can skip the last exam if you study enough for the first three. Would highly recommend to anyone who needs the credit. ",

This was also by far the easiest course I've taken. Regardless, it was still incredibly interesting to learn about primate bio, evolution, ecology.

Lecture is a bit boring too.",
