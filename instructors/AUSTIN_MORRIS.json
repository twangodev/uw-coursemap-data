He reads straight from lecture slides and the majority of the tests are on readings, which there are a ridiculous number of. He puts on a front like he is a cool, hip prof but he's actually the worst.",

Had a hard time coming to class cuz i could see Austin reading his script from behind the podium! This isn't an acting class dude. Speak organically and you'll probably one have a less than half full class by the end of the semester! Zero stars!",

Going to discussion and speak once in a while means a C, TopHat discussion means you have to do every single one and no leniency, said Twitter needed at least 5 but in the end you need 10, pathetic grading by Joe and Austin.",

The strictness of criteria is NOT made clear at all. The descriptions for assignments are too vague to reach the high standards of the graders. Very stingy with attendance policy.",
