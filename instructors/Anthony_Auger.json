He is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about epigenetics. Guy is hilarious. Grades were based on two presentations of research, an exam (which was very clear), a final paper, and easy participation. Amazing class and prof",

Assignments seemed difficult but he is very helpful and wants everyone to succeed. He's an all-around great guy and great professor. I learned a lot in his class!",

Though he talked fast at times, he was always very clear and his TAs always did a great job explaining things during discussion. Everything you need to know in order to do well on exams gets repeated and emphasized in lectures. Pay attention and come to class!",
