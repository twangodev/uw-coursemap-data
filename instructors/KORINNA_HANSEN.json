It's not possible to skip class or BS assignments without getting a poor grade. Get ready to memorize dozens of academic papers and graphs because her exams require you to know the material with absolute precision!",

One gripe is the speed in which she goes through lectures due to putting class notes online beforehand, thinking students actually print them off (they don't). Definitely a tier below Johnson but not a bad professor by any means. Rather difficult tests. Final avg was 64%",
