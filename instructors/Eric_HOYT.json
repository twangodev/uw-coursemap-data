My only complaint is that the projects are very fast paced, but my TA wasn't too harsh when it came to grading. Lots of group work, and you'll have to put time out of class for some of the projects",

Grade is based on attendance and mostly group projects.  I feel like the projects should be given a rubric on how to be graded or something, but it wasn't too harsh.  Tests were cake.  Highly recommend this class.",
