I would recommend doing your hw during these movies",

Read the cases and you're golden, she explains everything else you need in class. A bit intimidating, but a really cool lady once you get to know her. One of the best law classes I've taken on campus.",

She is a very intimidating prof and makes the class seem like it is harder than it is, but overall she is very helpful and interesting.  Don't be afraid to ask questions--chances are you'll feel stupid but she'll help you out.  Sometimes a bit full of herself, but she's accomplished a lot",
