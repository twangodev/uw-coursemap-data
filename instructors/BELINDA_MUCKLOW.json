She trys to keeps class really interesting and works in other topics outside of finance to mix it up a little, the first 15 mintues are usually about what is going on in the news and other random facts/stories.  The exams are tough, but if you study the old exams and do the homework you should be okay. do not get behind!",

Only grades are exams. Final is 50 MC.",
