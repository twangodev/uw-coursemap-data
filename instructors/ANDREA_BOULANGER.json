Homework was pretty challenging as it was worth less than 10 points, so a couple points off meant a bad grade. You had to explain everything in depth and it often wasn't clear what she was looking for in a response. Otherwise, I recommend!",

Wasn't until my 3rd out of 5 did I get the hang of it (bad overall grade  at semester start). Online tests were not as bad tho. Wouldn't have been as rough if I went to hours earlier imo. ",
