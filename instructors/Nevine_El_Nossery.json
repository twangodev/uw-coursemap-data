When you have questions outside of class, she either does not email back or emails back with a response that does not make much sense. She also does not give much time to prepare for tests or essays which makes the class much harder.",

When you get something wrong, the mandatory participation, she's so judgemental and makes you feel stupid for not understanding. She doesn't give you time to think of an answer but keeps pushing and pushing for someone to answer. She's good, but could be better.",
