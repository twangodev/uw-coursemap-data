I went into the class thinking it was going to be extremely difficult but he made the concepts easy to understand and enjoyable. The class being at 8 am was rough but he posted the recordings. He made an effort to learn every students name and genuinely cares to see us succeed. ",

Luedtke himself is a kind and interesting guy who seems to want students to actually learn, and is very understanding and accommodating of life. He made one of the worst ISyE classes a) understandable b) interesting enough that I want to take more classes on the topic. Highly reccomend.",

Not many choices for 323 professors, but if you take Prof. Luedtke be prepared to put in a lot of time and to be ridiculed if you ask questions.",

The only negative thing I have to say is that he often has mistakes in lecture notes, exams, and hw. Sometimes the mistakes can inhibit learning b/c it makes the content confusing. But ask him and he will correct it immediately.",
