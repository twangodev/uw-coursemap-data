If you take them with friends, you can ace them every week. Highly recommend this class",

Almost half of your grade is from your volunteer hours, and another fourth is from online (open note) quizzes. Lec slides are online, but Nancy often gives exam hints during class. The actual material is interesting and eye opening. Take this!",

The exams are extremely easy as long as you put in an hour or two to review and the weekly quizzes are a breeze. Although the 3 hour once a week lecture can be long, all the lectures are fascinating and inspiring. I highly recommend!",
