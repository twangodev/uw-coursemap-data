He jumps into lectures with no background on the topic or the people, which makes it hard to figure out what is actually going on.  Lectures are poorly organized as a whole.

It's all directly from the notes in class or the readings.  All the material is there. Plus, he meets outside of class to talk about anything and everything.  Also, he goes over lectures early if you must be absent. Amazing",

Only 4 assignments per se, however, they're a lot of work and the reading is nearly impossible to keep up with.  However, this guy knows and loves his field more than anyone I've met.  If you're not affraid to work, have the best time of your life in this class",

He assigns a lot of reading & you'll be copying a lot out of the reserves section. But very friendly and a pretty dry sense of humor. Also this class is hard if you don't have a background. Overall, a good prof. :)",
