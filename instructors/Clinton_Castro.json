If you wanted to, you could totally scrape an A in this class without going to most of the classes, but if you have the time, I highly recommend that you attend lecture every day. They're super interesting, and it'll make the papers a lot easier. Also, find something to nerd out about and then go to office hours whenever you can.",

The lecture is pointless, as he just discusses philosophy papers that students need to write papers about.
