None of the assignments are particularly difficult, but there are a ton of them. Make sure you stay on top and ahead of everything and you should be able to earn an A",

Warning, J202 is NOT easy, you will have to work, but its generally fun interactive work. I was worried about having two 3 hour labs a week, but our lab became best friends quickily. Favorite class at UW.",
