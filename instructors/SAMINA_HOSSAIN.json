To be fair, she does seem like a good person who got thrown into teaching this at the last minute. Because of this, her slides are impossible to follow and the class is disorganized. She is super soft spoken and hard to follow.",

Her lecture notes contain useless/confusing examples & speaking notes for herself rather than things that are useful to look back on. Her voice is monotoned & the lectures are unbearable to get through.  You're better off skipping the lectures & learning the material through the textbook",

The study guides for the exam are helpful, but like 40 pages altogether and was way too much. The course content was interesting. The class had easy ways to get a good grade, however. I would try to take from another professor.",
