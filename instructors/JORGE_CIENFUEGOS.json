The content of the class is boring because it focuses on grammar but Jorge went over the key points from each chapter during lecture. I rarely read the textbook, but you need it for homework and it's helpful for harder units. Grading was based on 3 essays and he looked for improvement in your writing.",

There were 3 papers for the semester and 1 assignment each week. The class is graded on whether or not you made progress over the semester, so you don't actually get any grades until the end of the semester.",

The course material is pretty easy in itself but he creates a friendly and jovial atmosphere in class which makes talking in Spanish or saying the wrong things less intimidating. He is very hip and sassy but also kind and informative when you need help. He plays music videos at the end of class which is great to pack bags to!",
