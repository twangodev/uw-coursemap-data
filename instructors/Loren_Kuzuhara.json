I just finished one that was, including mandatory youtube links, a bunch of useless information that wasted 2.5 HOURS OF MY TIME. I'm sick of hearing comments about netflix/his dogs/irrelevant info when I could be doing other things. Also he is so rude.",

Absolutely  horrible and you learn nothingworthwile!",
