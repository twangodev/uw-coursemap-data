If you attend lecture, keep up with the readings, and participate in section you will do great. Even if you're not going into Journalism, the course concepts are super interesting, relevant, and easy to grasp. I would recommend this class to everyone.",

Not afraid to call students out in class or on Twitter. Good at what she does but definitely pray that you have an easy TA for your grading. Extra credit was my lifesaver for her.",
