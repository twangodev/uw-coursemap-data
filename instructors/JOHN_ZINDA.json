Does not post grading scale on syllabus (only tells you halway through the semester). Asks for your opinion only to tell you how wrong you are. Exams are impossible and most of the class failed big % assignments.",

He is so unorganized, sneaks his strict grading scale in, hides stuff from his syllabus, and is overall not helpful. I went to his office hours on several occasions seeking help, and received nothing in the form of a pointed direction. He is also very, very awkward.",

He's new to Cornell and has just tried a bunch of weird stuff when it comes to grading and assignments and evaluating. The grading seems totally subjective and he loves quizzing the class on tiny tidbits of information that you probably won't remember from last night's 80-page reading",
