Izabella's review sessions and office hours are tremendously helpful, but be prepared to spend an inordinately large chunk of time doing the homework and preparing for exams with this class (MS&E 451). She grades fairly, but expects much of you.  Overall, I throrughly enjoyed the class and learned a LOT",
