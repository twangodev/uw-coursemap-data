He clearly cares so much about his class and what he teaches, he forms close bonds with the class and knows student names, and the lectures are engaging and fun. I am not a history person, and I was consistently able to participate in discussions. This was a very efficient & well thought out class.",

He was very clear with what his expectations for assignments were and was very flexible with due dates, especially because he does require them to be printed.
