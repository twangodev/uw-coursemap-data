In discussion we hardly EVER discussed lecture material, just talked about &quot;culture.&quot;  He called on the same 3-4 people in my discussion, giving no one else a chance to earn participation.  Definitely favors people.  Extremely picky with essays, but doesn't give advice on how to improve.",

However, if you want your Spanish abilities to improve- I advise you to take Arsenio. I had him as a TA for 223, and I really enjoyed his class. He may speak quickly, but it helped me pronounce better!",

DUE DATES CHANGE ALL THE TIME.  LOTS of busy work, but at least it was easy.  You'll need to learn everything on your own time outside of class to succeed.",

On the plus side, if you go to office hours he will help you a ton, and you will probably get a fair grade.  Be prepared to talk in class!",

As a Spanish major, I was very upset that I was doing and learning nothing, while the class next door was learning a whole bunch.  He's not very helpful with his corrections and the due dates for things are never what he says they are.  Have fun with this one.",
