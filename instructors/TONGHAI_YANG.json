If you already understand the material he makes a lot of sense, but that's the problem, he's supposed to teach you.  The book was extremely necessary, and so was Khan Academy. If you know the material well, his exams are somewhere between average to easy. Form a group or teach yourself.",

Very hard to follow sometimes in lecture, and he likes to write useless proofs on the board. Tests are easy. Not a bad teaching option.",
