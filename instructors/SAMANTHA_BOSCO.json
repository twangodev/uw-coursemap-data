Participation matters in discussions because you are graded weekly, 2-3 page papers are due every week with longer papers/projects due every 6 weeks.

The weekly 2+ page papers were excessive and annoying to complete, and despite providing a clear rubric, there are just too many nit-picky things. Flat out responding to the rubric is your best bet at an A. ",
