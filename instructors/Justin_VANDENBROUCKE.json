His lectures are very organized and the material is quite applicable and interesting, so make sure to pay attention (despite his monotone voice).

Participation counts as Top hat in lecture and presence in discussion section. Homework part, you have to write an article response around 200-300 words about energy topic, and every Friday afternoon there is a problem set of 4-5 questions from the book due. These are just basic info about the course. Back to the professor, he is really really boring. He speaks the same tone all the time and makes people want to go to sleep. Lectures are tedious and you really cannot learn too much from the course. There are very detailed questions in midterms on multiple choices, really recommend reading through all the points on the slides which will be posted on learn uw. All in all, he is not the best professor but the course itself is not difficult.",
