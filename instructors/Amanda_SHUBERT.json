Weve learned a lot about feminism, which isnt bad, but I didnt sign up for a genders study class. Unless you LOVE foreign film, dont take",

The professor showed absolute no proficiency in the content she is teaching on and relates every film made in human history to feminism. I suggest drop ASAP.",
