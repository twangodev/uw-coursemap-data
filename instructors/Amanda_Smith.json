She made a historically difficult class very manageable, homework wasn't too bad, and the exams consisted of fair questions. She answered questions online and during her office hours. She never made things harder than they needed to be and focused on the underlying concepts over mastery.",

The group project is quite a bit of work, so stay on top of it. Homework was 45% of your grade, so doing well on the assignments made the tests less stressful. She answered questions online quickly and was fair with grading.",

Most lectures were guest speakers, so it's hard to judge her teaching, but I learned a lot nonetheless. She cared about her students and answered any and all questions too.",
