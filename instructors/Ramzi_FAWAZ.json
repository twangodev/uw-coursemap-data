No study guide. Also there is a ten page group paper that has no guidelines at all. All group members get the same grade no matter what, so no group member evaluations. Just an overall bad.",

Instead spend 50 min twice a week listening to a hobo ramble on the street. Same result. They feel important, and you're all confused and just want to leave. A 3CR CLASS WITH A 5CR WORKLOAD!!!!!",
