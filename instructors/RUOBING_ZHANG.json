Often, it is hard to get some of the formulae he used, maybe he thought those things were 'obvious'. The final is extremely difficult and extremely tough graded.

However, it seems to be as difficult as a graduate-level course due to my average math ability. I strongly recommend this course to students who aim to pursue a graduate degree in pure math.

Homework and exams are mostly reasonable, but sometimes it randomly gets extremely hard (such as on the Midterm and last HW).

If his teaching method is that \"prefect\" as he imagine, he can surely wrote his own textbook, and recommend other universities to use. However, this has not become reality. I respect that you graduate from Princeton, but this doesn't automatically implies well teaching.",
