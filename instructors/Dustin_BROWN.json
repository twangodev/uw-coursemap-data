He is a very passionate, intelligent, and excellent instructor who puts in a lot of effort to make the material approachable.

Funny and relatable, I would 100% take another class with him! Grading is a bit intense as it is mostly just two legal briefs and two exams that make up your grade, but not terrible",

Has a good sense of humor, is receptive to feedback and what you'd like to understand more of, and is willing to meet with you outside of class so long as you are prepared to ask questions. Reading is necessary for the final exam.",
