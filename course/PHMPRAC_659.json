    "description": "Antimicrobial Stewardship has emerged as an important component of patient care in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Pharmacists can play an essential role in Antimicrobial Stewardship through application of knowledge in pharmacology, therapeutics, pharmacokinetics, microbiology, and biotechnology, most often expressed in the acute care setting, where patient health status and therapeutic decision making are ongoing. Addresses the ever-changing skill set required for pharmacists to understand therapeutic options and make effective interventions in the care of infected patients. Emphasis is placed on new treatment modalities as well as challenging the status quo of conventional management principles.",
