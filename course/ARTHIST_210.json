    "description": "Why were the ancient Egyptians obsessed with building elaborate tombs? Was the Taj Mahal really a monument to love? Why do the Greeks want the Parthenon marbles returned? Was Frank Lloyd Wright \"modern?\" How have buildings reflected and shaped the historical forces of the modern age, from colonialism, to industrialization, to globalization? Take a journey through space and time and explore the history of the world through its great buildings. Learn to recognize, analyze, and question the dynamic interaction between culture, politics, religion, and architectural form. Perhaps more than any other visual art, architecture is alive. Buildings shapeshift over decades, centuries, millennia. They stand as both witnesses to and agents of historical change. Unpack our buildings' histories to reveal their role in our shared human story.",
