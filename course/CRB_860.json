    "description": "The molecular and cellular development of the heart and of its regenerative potential. This knowledge forms the basis for novel translational research and both diagnostic and therapeutic options. Topics to be covered include the genetics underlying normal heart development as well as cardiac tissue specification and differentiation with a focus on molecular signals, associated signal transduction pathways, and transcriptional regulation. Read, discuss, and present cutting-edge literature on the genetic contributions to congenital heart defects and adult heart disease and on cardiac stem cells and the regenerative capacity of the heart. Participate in Adult and Pediatric Cardiology Grand Rounds, the Madison Perinatology Conference, learn about cutting-edge molecular diagnostics for fetal, pediatric and adult cardiac disease, and learn when and how to perform an adult echocardiogram.",
