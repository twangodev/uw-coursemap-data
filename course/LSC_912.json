    "description": "Focuses on the intersections of science, politics, and communication, and their implications for public opinion and public understanding of science, particularly in the context of controversial science and technology issues. A solid understanding of public opinion and communication dynamics surrounding today's controversial science issues requires deep knowledge of core concepts and theories of political polarization, attitudes, and information processing, especially in the context of contemporary digital media environments. Focus on how these concepts and theories are applied in contemporary research on public opinion about science and science-related issues.  Consider how such applications may potentially offer new and unique opportunities for deeper understanding of broader dynamics of contemporary communication.",
