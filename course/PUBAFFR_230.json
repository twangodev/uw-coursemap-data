Seek to understand and contextualize the partisan conflict present in modern American politics and policymaking today and explore individual-level tactics that public policy leaders, practitioners, and advocates may use that acknowledge conflict and attempt to move public policymaking forward. Explore ways in which policy conflict can be understood, managed, and channeled for the betterment of public policy decision-making in a divided America.",
