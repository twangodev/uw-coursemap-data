    "description": "India is home to one of the largest film industries in the world, Bollywood. Beyond Bollywood, India has a thriving film culture that caters to its many regional languages. Explore India's diverse, yet interconnected film and media cultures as well as the global resonances of Indian- and South-Asian-inflected media elsewhere. Examine questions of diasporic identity through media produced by the South Asian American community. Consider questions of genre, style and auteurship, ethnicity, decolonization, gender non-conformity, caste, settler colonialism, censorship and linguistic nationalism that shape cinematic discourses in the country and its intersection with South Asian diaspora in the United States.",
