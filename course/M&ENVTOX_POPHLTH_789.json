    "description": "Provides an overview of the field of environmental health, using a systems thinking approach. Systems thinking recognizes that environmental health problem solving is complex and that solutions in one area may have positive or negative impacts on other areas. An introduction to the history of environmental health within the field of public health from the local to the federal and global level. Introduces multiple disciplines, methods and approaches to numerous environmental health topics. Includes introduction to methods and tools necessary for assessing human health risks from a variety of environmental hazards and exposures found in air, land, and water with a focus on physical and chemical risks. Additional details regarding specific hazard, exposure and health outcome data and their relationship to environmental health risk assessment, environmental health decision-making and management form a public health practice perspective will be discussed.",
