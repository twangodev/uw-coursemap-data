    "description": "An academic and experiential introduction to mindfulness meditation framed within the perspective of psychology is provided. Scientific research and modern meditation instructions that have formed the basis of a variety of secular mindfulness-based interventions are reviewed. Readings will adopt a variety of perspectives and methodologies, including conceptual/theoretical work, clinical trials, review articles including meta-analyses (i.e., aggregating findings across studies), and measurement-oriented studies. Key topics include: Buddhist and historical underpinnings of secular mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and similar interventions (e.g., lovingkindness and compassion-based meditation), and empirical literature pertaining to neuroscientific and clinical effects of mindfulness training and related interventions.",
