Discovery and interpretation of microbial biosignatures in the context of a simulated surface lander mission through travel to field sites. Introduction to microbial biosignatures as inferred through satellite and drone imagery interpretation, portable XRF elemental analysis, UV-VIS-IR spectrophotometry, body and trace fossil analysis and interpretation, and metagenome sequencing. Explore evidence and methods of detection of life on other planets.",
