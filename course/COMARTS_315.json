Consider the legal basis for reproductive rights and key Supreme Court decisions relating to birth control and abortion. Examine core questions: how have reproductive rights been defined differently in different historical moments? What are rights in the context of reproduction? Who has reproductive freedom, and whose reproduction has been controlled? What role does race play in the history of reproductive justice? How does class influence people's access to reproductive healthcare? How does analyzing gender help us understand the history of reproductive justice?",
