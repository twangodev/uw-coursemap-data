    "description": "This doctoral level strategy research seminar invites students to explore drivers of performance heterogeneity among firms. Why do some firms out-perform others? The topic is integrative in that the answer draws on theory and empirical evidence from economics, sociology, and psychology, as well as management and organizational theory that is more interdisciplinary in nature. In studying this topic, we also focus on the research process: what is the anatomy of a scholarly contribution in strategy and how does one conduct strategy research?",
