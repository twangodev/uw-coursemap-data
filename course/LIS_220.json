    "description": "Each of us leaves behind digital information traces, our \"digital footprint\", as we go about our daily lives. Learn about the different kinds of technologies involved in capturing this information, who owns it and controls it, and how it is used to make our lives easier and less private at the same time. Consider what information can be tracked and inferred about us based on our digital traces, what is gained (and lost) as individuals and society by allowing our digital footprints to continue to expand, and debate what future technologies and policies concerning this information should be like.",
