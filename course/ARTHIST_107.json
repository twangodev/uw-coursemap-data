    "description": "Considers the many fascinating ways in which cultures represented ideas of health, sex, disease, medicine, and death, focusing on the ways different art forms (painting, sculpture, architecture, prints, photography, textiles, decorative arts, hair, costume, music and dance, food) conveyed historically and culturally distinctive ideas about bodies.  Linking the topics will be an attention to how notions of race, gender, and disability determine representations of the body. Enjoy an introduction to basic skills in visual interpretation that are widely applicable in today's world, while covering health and body-related topics chosen from the arts of Europe, China, Japan, Africa, the Islamic World, and the United States. Our objects of study range from ancient Greece and Rome to the present, with an emphasis on nineteenth- to twenty-first century art.",
