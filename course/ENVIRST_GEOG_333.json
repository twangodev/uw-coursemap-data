    "description": "Over half of the world's population now lives in urban areas, with an expected increase of 2.5 billion people in the next 30 years. As urbanization (broadly defined as the conversion of previously undeveloped lands into urbanized uses) continues and intensifies, we are faced with a number of environmental issues, for instance, fragmentation and destruction of habitats, and decreased air and water quality.  Explore how urbanization impacts ecological processes and resulting environmental outcomes, strategies for \"designing with nature,\" and behavioral, planning, and policy responses to urban environmental problems.",
