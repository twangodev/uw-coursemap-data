    "description": "Considers the social and cultural history of 20th and early 21st century American medicine through the depiction of health care practitioners and health care systems in Hollywood movies. View films that featured medicine, doctors, nurses, patients, and hospitals. Using these films as primary sources, seek to place these representations into a broader social and cultural context. Evaluate the extent to which popular understandings of medicine, health, and healing as portrayed in the films corresponded to actual practices of medicine and medical research at the time the films were first screened for mass audiences.",
