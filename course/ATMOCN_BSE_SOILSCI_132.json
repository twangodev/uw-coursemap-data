As humans increase their impact on Earth's water cycle, our understanding of the multiple roles of water becomes critical to finding sustainable strategies for human and ecosystem health. Explore different perspectives around cultural significance of, engagement with, and access to water, with particular focus to case studies from the United States. Identify the human influence on water quality and quantity in a changing global climate, from local, regional, and global perspectives, and how different racial and ethnic communities in the United States are differentially impacted.",
