    "description": "Fundamental to all religions are shared beliefs about human beings' relation to that which they regard as holy, sacred, spiritual, divine, or worthy of reverence. Focuses on how religions around the world, from antiquity to the present, mediate sacred and divine presence through material means, aimed to stimulate the human senses. Considers the questions: What makes particular places sacred? How do architecture and ritual contribute to the fashioning sacred worship spaces or places of pilgrimage and healing in diverse religious traditions? How do some religions use icons/images, painted or sculpted, to mediate divine presence, while others consider figural images to be idols? How do art, architecture, and even landscapes serve as places of memory and convey fundamental beliefs about the afterlife?",
