    "description": "Exploration of state-building: examining how states are formed, how they develop and maintain political power, and the ways in which they shape society. Draw on insights from political science, but also economics, history, and anthropology, to learn about the processes of state formation, the importance of state capacity, and the state's role in war, governance, and social justice. Topics will include the relationship between the state and issues like the environment, gender, and identity, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities states face in a rapidly changing world. Analysis of historical and contemporary examples from various political systems yields insights into the state's role as both a force for order and a driver of social change. Lectures, discussions, and case studies, will lead to a deeper understanding of the state's central role in global politics and everyday life.",
