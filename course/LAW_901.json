    "description": "Explores American constitutional law governing speech, association, the press, and religion.  It focuses on the leading First Amendment cases that have created the most expansive protection for expression anywhere in the world. Consider not only the reasons for protecting these rights, but also countervailing interests - such as public safety, national security, and equality - that may justify restrictions on expression. Consider arguments that the U.S. Supreme Court has gone too far in protecting some forms of speech and association, such as false statements, sexually explicit materials, hate speech, and corporate political spending.",
