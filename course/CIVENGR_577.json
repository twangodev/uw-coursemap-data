Starting from the basic concepts defining traffic streams, existing theories are presented at different scales, including car-following (microsimulation) models, lane-changing models, cellular automata models, the kinematic wave model, and macroscopic/network fundamental diagram.  Techniques for empirical analysis. Connected and automated vehicles.",
