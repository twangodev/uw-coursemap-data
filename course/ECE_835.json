    "description": "Light-matter interactions with quantum systems and their applications in quantum computing, communications, and sensing. Brief review of quantum mechanics and derivation of quantum structure of atoms. Deeper exploration of concepts and applications of quantum optics (such as use of nonclassical light, entangled photons) and experimental techniques on how to control and measure quantum systems with photons (including atom cooling and trapping, coherent interactions, putting atoms in cavities). Knowledge of introductory-level classical electromagnetism (such asE\u00a0C\u00a0E\u00a0220orPHYSICS\u00a0202) and modern physics (such asPHYSICS/\u200bE\u00a0C\u00a0E\u00a0\u00a0235orPHYSICS\u00a0241) required.",
