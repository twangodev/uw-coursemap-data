    "description": "Provides an introductory overview to critical global health studies, linking past trends to current research and health inequalities. Examines current trajectories in disaster relief and public health interventions through a gendered lens, with a solid grounding in the historical context. Explores social, demographic, political, economic, and ecological determinants of global health, and the ways that these factors interconnect with biomedicine to create and affect health outcomes, both within and across countries. Uses an intersectional approach to analyze how public health policies prioritize whose lives represent \"save-able\" or \"salvageable\" ones in the public, political, and corporate eye.",
