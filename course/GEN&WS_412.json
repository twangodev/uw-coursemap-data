    "description": "Queer art and visual culture are defined not only through their subject matter but also by the methods through which they appropriate and subvert conventional visual practices.  Such tactics may include a work's means of production, its formal properties, and the conditions of its reception.  The political imperatives of a queer or queered position, linked to the intersections of race, class, sex and gender will shape thematic investigations of practices related to activism, documentation, abstraction, mining the archive, craft, camp, and drag, among others.  Case studies will be drawn from film, performance, comics, video games, and fine art.  Projects will engage text- and studio-based research in an interdisciplinary push to integrate theory and practice.  No prior art or design experience required.",
