    "description": "What do we mean when we talk about nature? What does it mean to call something natural? Are humans part of nature, and is human difference a product of nature or culture? An introduction to the concepts of nature, culture, and race in both the ancient Mediterranean and contemporary US society with an emphasis on how ancient accounts of human difference have shaped-and continue to shape-modern discourse. Approaching the topics of race, nature, and the environment using critical resources afforded by the humanities, consider how the nature/culture binary is deployed in definitions for race and ethnicity, and show how the experiences of racially marginalized groups in the United States are impacted by ancient debates surrounding nature and human difference, as well as their re-articulation over the intervening millennia.",
