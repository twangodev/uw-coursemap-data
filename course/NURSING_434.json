    "description": "Builds on health and illness concepts by focusing on individuals, families, and communities recognizing their unique attributes. Concepts included: acid-base balance, cellular regulation, intracranial regulation, genomics, sexuality and reproduction, and an introduction to the organization of the community/public health system. Other core nursing concepts are revisited as they apply to the community as client or in complex care situations. The nursing process frames learning activities that foster understanding the nursing role in providing evidence-based care to individuals, families across the lifespan, and to communities experiencing related health and illness concerns in collaboration with an interprofessional team.",
