    "description": "Focuses on the concepts and practices used to define systems while providing opportunities to build competencies with systems thinking to describe, assess, understand, and manage complexity from local to global scales. Considers a range of topics, including systems science, complexity, behavior of adaptive systems, networks, emergence, and patterns of organization. Develops skills to analyze how the design and implementation of integrated systems can contribute to solutions for pressing societal challenges. Examines social, physical, and natural systems, the rise of complexity, and achieving resilience in social-ecological systems. Examines the components of systems and analyzes how different ecological and social contexts influence system behavior. Explores and analyzes how decisions ramify to influence processes and outcomes at different levels of complexity.",
