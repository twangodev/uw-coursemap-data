    "description": "Covers a range of topics related to human genetics and evolution. Explores questions about what genetic differences between humans tell us about our species' evolutionary and demographic history, and conversely, how our history has shaped the genetic diversity of people living today. At a time of rapidly increasing ability to sequence huge numbers of genomes such questions play a central role in understanding how genetics impacts individuals' disease risks, how to interpret reported ancestry and family history from direct-to-consumer genotyping kits, and how genetics can (or importantly, cannot) inform descriptions of human diversity and concepts of race. Includes topics of diversity and inclusion in genomics studies, with a focus on the application and limits of results obtained from one group to our understanding of other groups.",
