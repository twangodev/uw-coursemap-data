Prepare boring logs and install groundwater monitoring well.  Properly prepare samples for preservation and shipment. Prepare and maintain defensible field documentation. Use quality control sampling, data verification and validation, and data quality assessment. Decontaminate drilling and field sampling equipment and manage investigative-derived waste.",
