    "description": "Examine women, gender, and sex and their interactions with public policy. Learn about equality, liberty, feminism, and intersectionality, whether these concepts should be incorporated into policymaking, and if so, how that can be accomplished through gender mainstreaming and gender policy analysis. Examine specific policy areas focused on women's social, economic, and political citizenship to understand the causes and consequences of gender discrimination. These specific policy areas include poverty, women's labor market participation, immigration, reproductive rights, sexuality, gender-based violence, climate change, transportation, and peace and security. Understand how gender is embedded in the politics of policymaking, and what strategies have been successful in achieving more gender-equitable policies across the globe.",
