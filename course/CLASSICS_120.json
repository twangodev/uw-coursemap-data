    "description": "Covers the crisis of fakes and forgeries in the world of classical antiquities, with emphasis on ancient Greek and Roman art from the period 1200 BCE to 400 CE, but also including comparative cases in the world of modern art. Introduces the basic vocabulary of fakes and, by means of readings and discussions, generates knowledge around the impact that fakes and forgeries have on perceptions of past civilizations and truths of the present day. Learn how to distinguish originals from counterfeits, how fakes and forgeries can distort understandings about the past and present, how to deploy tools for art historical analysis and the study of forgeries, how to discuss ethical problems in classical antiquities with peers, how to identify and organize evidence and scholarship to produce coherent and cogent arguments, and how to think critically about the impact of ancient art (both real and fake) in modern times.",
