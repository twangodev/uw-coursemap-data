    "description": "Explores the historical connections between capitalism and religion. Considers if and how religious ideas and practices facilitated the rise of capitalism; asks whether religious institutions have supported the reproduction of social inequalities, unjust labor practices, and exploitative economies; and studies the role played by religious actors in the critique of capitalism. Pays attention to the historical specificity of the capitalist system, its conditions of emergence in the Christian West, and the effects of its globalization on non-Christian traditions. Covers topics including classical social theories of religion and capitalism; contemporary examples of religious practice and capital accumulation; and the relationship between religious movements and social-economic justice.",
