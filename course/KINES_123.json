    "description": "Focuses on the application of biological, cultural and social theory and research to lifestyle change. There will be lectures by experts, experiential learning, and the application of course knowledge to student's lives through class assignments and activities. The transition to college requires students to construct a new lifestyle, take on new and greater personal responsibilities while at the same time meet rigorous academic challenges. This transition includes a loss of structured daily schedules, decreased family support for the day to day living, and greater responsibility for their finances and life choices. Students may have difficulty managing their time, exercise less, eat less healthy foods, engage in increased drinking of alcohol, and experience greater stress and depression when adjusting to college life. This life transition provides an opportunity for reexamination and an opportunity to make thoughtful choices about lifestyle.",
