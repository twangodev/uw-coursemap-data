    "description": "Critical Indigenous Ecological Knowledges are a set of diverse understandings, responsibilities, and laws held by distinct groups of Indigenous peoples that are enacted in multiple ways across socio-political and geographical contexts. These knowledges intersect with Indigenous political sovereignties and longstanding, complex, and nuanced relationships to the more-than-human world. Learn multiple entry points to exploring and examining these knowledge sets in the context of what's for now called the U.S. and Canada to think critically about the politics of Nature, environmentalism, race, indigeneity, and colonialism both historically and in the contemporary moment. Reflect upon how critical Indigenous knowledges about ecology, environment, and government have been erased, co-opted, criminalized, and also continually practiced, reimagined, and revitalized in multiple spheres through a range of interdisciplinary, critical, and cutting-edge Native scholarships and writings.",
