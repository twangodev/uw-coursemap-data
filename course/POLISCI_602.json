    "description": "The public policy process is structured argument and decision making within institutional contexts. This class introduces students to analytic frameworks for thinking about various aspects of this process. We do not study a single context or policy, but, rather, seek to understand how policies might succeed (or fail) in one context or another. The principal framework is institutional analysis, or the way in which formal and informal rules shape policies and their outcomes. Students will learn to perform institutional analysis as well as write a memorandum presenting such an analysis to a policymaker. Students will align their final projects to their personal and professional activities and/or their internship. The course will help students understand how policies can achieve durable impact, and how progress made through policies can be defended amid institutional pitfalls.",
