    "description": "Indigenous foods of North America are a vital component of modern agricultural and food systems. Indigenous foods and foodways will be examined from interdisciplinary historical, legal, biological, and social perspectives. Historic indigenous foodways of the present-day upper Midwestern United States and the impact on food and seed sovereignty of settler colonialism and subsequent agricultural practices and policies will be explored. Current efforts to re-claim agricultural traditions and foodways to improve public health, economic opportunity, and food and seed sovereignty will be covered, including the right to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, to define one's own food and agriculture systems, and to control the mechanisms and policies that govern food distribution. Hands-on activities are featured; previous examples include cooking with indigenous foods, ice fishing, and tapping maple trees for syrup.",
