    "description": "Explore the history of student activism in the United States, with an emphasis on the experiences racial/ethnic minority youths who have been marginalized or discriminated against. What motivated students to become politically active, and what forms did their activism take? How did student activism vary across time and space and from one group of activists to another? Why did some students become activists while others did not? What role did education and educational institutions play in their activism? What impact have student activists had, and what do their histories reveal about the capacity and mechanisms for achieving racial equity in particular and for affecting social, political, and economic change more broadly?",
