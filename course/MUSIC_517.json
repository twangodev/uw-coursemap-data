    "description": "Consider the meaning of the words \"analysis\" and \"theory,\" specifically as they have been applied to the study of music. Gain an overview of music theory in higher education: the origin of contemporary analytical praxis, as well as critiques of that model. Take a deeper dive into current trends in analysis, focusing on non-conforming, ecumenical, and otherwise \"non-theoretical\" ways of talking and writing about music, including narrative, semiotics, hermeneutics, performance-based schemata, and others.",
