    "description": "Offers students the opportunity to apply knowledge of Infant, Early Childhood and Family Mental Health concepts, assessment and diagnosis to planning and implementation of relationship-based and individual treatment approaches as well as to program development and policy. Students will be introduced to best practices and evidence based multi-disciplinary treatment approaches to address a range of presenting issues, settings, and cultural contexts for vulnerable children who are evidencing social, emotional, behavioral or attentional disturbances and parents with psychiatric disorders. Implications for informing policy across systems of care will be addressed. During the course of the semester, students will benefit from invited state and national speakers and guest faculty and instructors from the UW speaking on their areas of expertise.",
