Students will be introduced to best practices and evidence based multi-disciplinary treatment approaches to address a range of presenting issues, settings, and cultural contexts for vulnerable children who are evidencing social, emotional, behavioral or attentional disturbances and parents with psychiatric disorders. Implications for informing policy across systems of care will be addressed. During the course of the semester, students will benefit from invited state and national speakers and guest faculty and instructors from the UW speaking on their areas of expertise.",
