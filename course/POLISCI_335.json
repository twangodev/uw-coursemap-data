    "description": "An introduction to theories and empirical work on social identities, focusing in particular on definitions and measurement. It has three main goals: First, examine various definitions of social identities and different types of identities (ethnicity, race, nationality, gender, class, and religion). Second, look at techniques and strategies that have been developed to measure identities (content and discourse analysis, surveys, interviews and ethnography, censuses). Third, examine empirical works on identities from a variety of geographical areas and methodological perspectives.",
