Evaluation of the unique nutritional requirements for athletes/active individuals on body composition, performance, and timing of nutrients and hydration related to pre-activity, during activity, and post-activity recovery. Application of these concepts with clinical conditions requiring specialized sports nutrition approaches such as diabetes, gastrointestinal disorders, eating disorders, micronutrients deficiencies and life cycle populations (youth/adolescent, pregnant and masters' athletes). Analysis of sports nutrition research to utilize evidenced-based practice and recommendations around ergogenic aids/supplements and other sports nutrition topics.",
