    "description": "South Asia has long been a region of significance in anthropology, offering rich and varied contexts for exploring questions about social organization, cultural practices, and religious diversity. Engage with evolving anthropological perspectives on the region, drawing from foundational theorizations of caste, kinship, and the state while attending to contemporary ethnographic insights on care, poverty, health, medicine, and gender. Address questions like: How does the ethnographic method reveal the complexities of social worlds and cultural life in South Asia? What insights and limitations does this approach offer? How might it be enriched with other analytical tools? Engage critically with anthropological theory and recent ethnographies to explore the structures, relationships, and beliefs that shape everyday experiences and broader social patterns in India and the region in local and global frameworks.",
