    "description": "How does literature help us understand animals and our relation to them? We address this question by exploring two types of representation: representation as depiction (the attempt to describe animals in literature) and representation as a legal or political act (the attempt to speak or act on behalf of animals). Organized around familiar animal categories - dogs, cats, horses, apes, birds, insects - we examine the representation of animals in modern literature as a way to give an account of the cultural history of human-animal relations and, in doing so, to make us reflect upon the social, political, and environmental consequences of this history at a time when animal species are disappearing at an alarming rate.",
