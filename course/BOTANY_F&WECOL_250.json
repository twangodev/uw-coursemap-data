    "description": "Provides an overview of the geography, ecology, and economic importance of the world's forest biomes. Learn how climate influences vegetation and, in-turn, how forests impact global climate. Meet scientists working to understand the astounding biodiversity and ecological complexity of forest ecosystems, and how these ecosystems support human life. Discuss the threats to forest ecosystems around the world, and hear from the people trying to protect them. Emphasizes the forest resources and services upon which humans depend, and how we can maintain these resources into the future. Analyze the idea of \"sustainability\" when it comes to forest management, hear alternative viewpoints about what this word means, and discuss potential trade-offs and conflicts. Look at the many real-world programs in place at the global, national, and local level to sustainably manage forests.",
