    "description": "Explore Italian comedy and dramatic literature across the centuries through close reading and discussion of selected plays, from its Roman origins to contemporary examples. Read and discuss texts representative of the major comedic modes (e.g. erudite, improvised, etc.), paying close attention to language and structure, genre debates, character typologies, performance history, and the cultural-historical contexts that informed playwrights. Aims are cultivating a deeper understanding of Italian sensibilities and cultural attitudes regarding humor and satire, love and sex, tragedy within comedy, history, gender politics, public/private space, social customs, class, and other issues.",
