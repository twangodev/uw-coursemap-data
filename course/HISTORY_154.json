    "description": "Organized around the title question: Who is an American? Explores how answers to that question have changed over time, focusing on people whose actions and ideas shaped those answers. Rather than an overview of U.S. history, focuses on a variety of topics related to our central theme, moving roughly chronologically from the Revolutionary era to the present. Covers the history of racial ideologies and racial inequities, arguments over citizenship and \"American\" identity, and the ways that various groups have been included or excluded from the nation.",
