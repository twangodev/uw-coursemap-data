    "description": "Why do people mobilize outside of routine political channels or institutions to pursue political change? How do we explain moments when people take to the streets or take up arms to accomplish their political goals?  At the heart of these questions is one that has long formed a core of social science inquiry: how do scholars explain collective action, particularly in the face of often serious risks. Examine these questions through exploring leading theoretical themes in the study of social movements, revolutions, and riots.   Explore how a variety of factors affect the where's, why's and how's of movement dynamics.",
