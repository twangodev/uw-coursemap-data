Reflect on personal goals and the nature of graduate study to confirm that a research-focused PhD is right for you. Consider whether to apply this year or later on, in light of admissions expectations and personal readiness. Identify research areas, PhD programs, and prospective advisors of interest. Improve application materials, strengthen interview skills, and consider individual priorities for selecting a program.",
