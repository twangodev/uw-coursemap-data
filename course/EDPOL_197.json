    "description": "What if our best teacher is all around us, even under our feet? For Indigenous peoples, whose worldviews, languages, and lifeways emerge from, and sustain, reciprocal relations to place, land is always teaching. Reflect on \"land as first teacher\" by considering Indigenous approaches to learning, Indigenous languages in relation to land, and the current environmental health of land. Seeks to live the principles of Indigenous learning through Indigenous foodways and experiential, place-based learning activities. Together, develop a personal relationship to Teejop (Four Lakes, or the Madison region), and explore generational responsibilities to Teejop. What does the land teach? And how do people learn to listen?",
