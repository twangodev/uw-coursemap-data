    "description": "Provides an introduction to the study of transitional justice (TJ), or how institutions - local, domestic, and international - address the legacies of human rights abuses. Explore several key questions motivating the study of transitional justice: Why do societies pursue accountability for past repression in general? How do transitioning societies go about these pursuits? What effects might TJ policies have on prospects for democracy, rule of law, and future human rights abuses? Special attention to how local and global politics interact to influence both the development and the effects of different transitional justice policies.",
