    "description": "Examines representations of soccer in sub-Saharan Africa. It is meant to make us think about African soccer as a cultural and political practice, while keeping in mind that this is a sport or a game. What does this sport, \"the beautiful game\" as it is called, the most widely followed and adored game, mean to Africans? What is the role of fans and spectators, alongside readers of literature and viewers of film? How does soccer link Africa to the rest of the world? Briefly cover the history of the game, in the world and in Africa, and its social impact; learn about both magic and racism in African soccer; read novels, discuss paintings, and watch films that represent soccer in meaningful ways and connect it to important issues of the neocolonial world.",
