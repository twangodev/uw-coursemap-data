    "description": "What happens to English drama after Shakespeare's death?  Public theaters closed, considered too racy for the moral health of the population. When they reopened in 1660, sex took center stage in productions of plays both old and new. Women acted on stages in London for the first time, both in roles originally written for cross-dressing boys and in new ones designed for female actors. Female playwrights entered the scene as well, writing for financial profit alongside their male counterparts. Read a sampling of plays and theatrical entertainments performed during the Restoration and eighteenth century as well as publications surrounding the world of the theater to gain a sense of drama on the page and on the stage.",
