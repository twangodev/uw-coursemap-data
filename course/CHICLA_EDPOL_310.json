    "description": "Develop a deeper understanding of U.S. higher education by examining connections between historical and present-day circumstances for a group of students often called the key to the sector's future. Latine students are the fastest growing population in postsecondary education today. Why did this growth happen? How has it impacted colleges and universities? How are Latine college students dealing with varying levels of institutional support? And what strengths do they bring to their education and future careers? By studying research from sociologists, historians, and education scholars, develop informed critiques of higher education and reimagine a better system for all.",
