    "description": "Continental political theory is a tradition of thought usually distinguished from 'Anglo-American political theory' and originally associated with French and German writers in the 19th and early 20th century.  What it means for humans to be free and what the requirements of a free society are the questions that motivate Continental political thought.  Topics include: what it means for humans to live freely; the nature of reason and language; the relationship between politics, reason and culture; the political effects of language and technology; and the competing models of political freedom that result.  Covers leading European political theories from the 18th through the 21st centuries and their application to contemporary questions of democratic theory.",
