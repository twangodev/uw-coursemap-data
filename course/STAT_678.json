    "description": "Develop statistical consulting skills to be able to communicate design and analysis to non-technical research collaborators. Provides a supportive environment to experiment with statistical consulting in practice, which will sometimes be uncomfortable and strange. Consulting problems typically do not have a \"right\" answer, and mistakes are encouraged. Take risks in sharing developing ideas in class. Connections with external organizations, such as the private sector and government agencies, will be made through possible internship experiences.",
