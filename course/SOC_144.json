Examine how social contexts and interactions create our understandings of a good life, including why we consider some things to be valuable, moral, or pleasurable. Develop an understanding of ways our wellbeing is contingent upon the actions of others. Evaluate conventional wisdom and scientific claims about what it means to live well and apply these concepts in your own life.",
