    "description": "The goal of this course is to arm Teaching Assistants with survival skills in scientific teaching through theory, practice, and learning community. We will work together to learn the core themes of scientific teaching (active learning, assessment, and diversity) and apply them, in real time, to the courses in which the TAs are concurrently teaching. This course is open to graduate students only.",
