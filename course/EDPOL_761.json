    "description": "Addresses political economic issues related to migration and education. Drawing on the anthropology of globalization and sociology of immigration, the course reviews major theories of immigrant incorporation and exclusion processes, examines case studies of im/migrants, refugees, and displaced persons and their adaptation processes in countries in the Global North and the Global South, and considers educational practices and policies that develop to address mobility in diverse contexts. The course examines how cultural, social, political, and economic factors influence im/migrant incorporation, and how educators can facilitate im/migrant students' opportunities for learning through changes in policies, pedagogies, and curricula.",
