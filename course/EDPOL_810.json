Topics will include: grassroots organizing and activism, pedagogies of the home, academic outcomes and access to higher education, full-service community-schools/school-community partnerships, social identity, funding and philanthropy, neoliberalism and education privatization, and after school and out-of-school time education. Examine the social and political context of community-based educational efforts in order to understand how they can be nurturing spaces of resistance for youth, as well as spaces of conflict and social reproduction.",
