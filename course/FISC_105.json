    "description": "In this course, students will learn the basics of genetic selection programs and the effectiveness of appropriate selection strategies specific to the dairy farm. Genomic testing research and advanced reproductive techniques will be discussed and students will learn about the correct application of these techniques on their farm. Basic anatomy of a dairy cow and linear scoring systems. After establishing dairy cow conformation and functionality and appraisal systems, students will evaluate cattle using type scorecards to improve the appearance, performance and longevity of dairy cattle. Following the understanding of the factors that impact the value of cattle, students will also learn how to apply corrective mating programs to improve perceived defects or nonexistent features in their herd(s).",
