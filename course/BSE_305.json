    "description": "Introduces managing agricultural production systems using Precision Agriculture (PA), including its modern extensions in smart and digital farming. Provides an overview of the fundamentals of agricultural production systems and the sources of crop variability. Explores geographic positioning and information systems, examining how these tools integrate yield and quality sensors to monitor spatial variability. Covers temporal observation techniques using remote and proximal sensing systems. Culminates in studying the technologies used for implementing and managing variable-rate prescriptions and other management interventions.",
