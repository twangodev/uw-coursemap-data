    "description": "Examines key concepts in social network theory and develops and applies them to the field of communication. Attention is paid to the differences between social and online networks, as well as their relationships. Explores major concepts and questions in social network theory and analysis, including the elements that make up a network; network relationships (e.g. homophily, knowing others like ourselves); the construction of whole social networks out of dyads (two people) and triads (three); strong and weak ties; roles and positions; groups, cliques, and clusters; as well as small worlds and communities. Emphasis will be on what these concepts mean and how they work. There will be minimal introduction to technical network analysis and hands- on work.",
