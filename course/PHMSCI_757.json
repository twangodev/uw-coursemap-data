    "description": "Survey of the drug development process from target identification, development, preclinical studies, clinical trials to post-approval monitoring, particularly as applicable to neuroactive drugs. Differences between small and large molecules (biologics) will be covered, along with a basic coverage of regulatory authorities. A brief history of drug development will be provided, along with coverage of special topics related to stages of the drug development process. Broad survey-style overview of the phases in the drug development process, regulatory considerations, relevant vocabulary, and the ability to communicate within the industry.",
