    "description": "Freshwater is one of our most valuable resources, and the basis for life itself. Explores contemporary threats and issues relating to freshwater ecosystems (lakes, rivers, wetlands) ranging from local to global. Covers a broad range of topics in freshwater sciences (invasive species, harmful algal blooms, overfishing, pathogens in drinking water) to provide a representative cross-section of the field. Material will tie directly to local and global societal issues. Integrates insights from biology with other disciplines (chemistry, geosciences, social sciences) to offer a deeper understanding of the threats to freshwater ecosystems, and how this affects human well-being.",
