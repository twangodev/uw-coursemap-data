    "description": "Introduction to the Jain tradition. Despite being a small minority religion, core Jain ethical and philosophical concepts of ahimsa (non-violence) and anekantavada (non-absolutism) have influenced all other major traditions in India and secular Indian society. Examines how Jain philosophy, ritual, social relations, and politics are informed by a commitment to ascetic ethics that uphold ahimsa as the greatest virtue for renouncers (monks and nuns) and lay practitioners, tracing the evolution of Jain ethical engagements with modern social and political issues including environmental and animal rights activism, business and finance, and medicine and bioethics. Course covers canonical texts and scholarly literature on Jainism to understand how ahimsa has been historically articulated within Jain philosophy and doctrine, re-articulated in modern social movements, and how it has been constructed in academic studies of Jainism.",
