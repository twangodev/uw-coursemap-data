    "description": "Education is often considered only to take place in formal schooling environments with professionally-trained teachers and students sitting in classrooms. However, research shows - and our intuitions suggest - that education occurs every day in a variety of ways, with a variety of people, and in a variety of spaces. For example, education - or more specifically, teaching and learning - happens in spaces such as museums and libraries but also, perhaps, at sports practice and around the family dinner table. Truly understanding what it means to teach and learn involves delving into and unpacking this variety. Further, if creating change in whether and how different people have opportunities to teach and learn in our society requires exposing and exploiting this variety.",
