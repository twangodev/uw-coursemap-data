    "description": "An interdisciplinary approach to understand human trafficking as a complex social phenomenon. The topic of human trafficking is analyzed through readings and a robust set of case studies, as part of a spectrum of interrelated violence, exploitation and systemic inequities influenced by various social determinants rooted in gender, power, class, sex, race, opportunity, education, culture, politics, access, and sexual orientation among other factors. Advocacy training will focus on commercial sexual exploitation and human trafficking with attention to supply and demand issues, vulnerability factors, immigration and law enforcement policies, and the overall impact on survivors' rights, health, and their status in society.",
