    "description": "Explore the complexities of what it means to be a media audience. Consider how audiences engage media thoughtfully and actively. Approach audiences both qualitatively and theoretically, focusing on how audiencehood becomes more than just a position of watching, listening, and downloading the intended message. Study audiencehood as a site of voice, agency, identity construction, play, activism, and meaning-making across various media audience types - fans, haters, casual viewers; television, film, social media, games, and other media consumers; watchers, listeners, readers, gamers, and users; networked communities and isolated individuals. Analyze the different worlds, affective positions, practices, and socialities that make up \"the audience.\"",
