Participate in regularly scheduled supervisor-student meetings, which involve some or all of the following: rounding on service patients, participating in scheduled operative procedures, presenting cases and teaching topics, and discussing patient cases. Assess patients and generate weighted differential diagnoses, initial work-ups, and management plans. Independently read about patient conditions and prepare for direct patient care, as needed. Attend conferences associated with the assigned orthopedic surgery service. Complete other patient care-related learning activities as assigned by instructors; these are dependent on the individual student, the patients under the student's care, and the location.",
