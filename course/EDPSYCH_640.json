    "description": "As instructional leaders, coaches play an important role in building the capacity and collective efficacy of school teams. Begin to explore the strategies at the heart of this process by engaging in discussions about the role of the instructional coach, the various models of instructional coaching, and the diverse ways instructional coaches collaborate with teachers and school leaders in and out of the classroom to support students as learners. Explore effective questioning techniques, coaching conversations, facilitation strategies, working with adult learners, navigating conflict, and verbal and nonverbal communication skills. While instructional coaches provide confidential, non-evaluative, job-embedded professional learning for fellow educators, they must also advocate for their own ongoing needs as learners, build trusting relationships with colleagues, and garner support from administration.",
