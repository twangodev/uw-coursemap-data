    "description": "What is humor? Why and when do people tell jokes? And what do we make of the fact that a certain form of humor has come to be labeled \"Jewish\"? Examine the notion of \"Jewish humor\" by reading a variety of texts (jokes, short stories, films, websites, conceptual art, and cultural kitsch). Begin by considering theoretical explorations of humor and \"Jewish humor.\" Then trace techniques of Jewish humor from eastern Europe to central Europe to North America, paying specific attention to Jewish American humor. Themes to be examined include: in-group vs. out-group humor; humor and ethnicity; performance and \"Jewface\"; Jewish-Christian difference; humor and the Holocaust; gender and ethnicity; the notion of self-hatred; American popular culture; and the relationship between humor, repetition, and innovation. The general goal is to answer the question: Is there such a thing as \"Jewish humor\"? (Hint: The answer may be \"no.\")",
