    "description": "Interact with and learn from multiple staff at Mendota Mental Health Institute (MMHI), including forensic psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, and occupational therapists. Interact with patients who have been committed to MMHI usually for forensic purposes- the patient has been found not guilty by reason of insanity, they are incompetent to stand trial, and/or their conditional release in the community has been revoked. Opportunity to see patients who have been civilly committed. Rotate with multiple psychiatrists, some of whom are specially trained in forensic psychiatry. Learn more about the forensic/legal system, the structure of medium and maximum security forensic psychiatry units, treatment of refractory psychotic and mood disorders, and the basics of forensic assessments. The student is given as much autonomy as possible with individual supervision and discussion.",
