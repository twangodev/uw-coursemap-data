    "description": "Explore the biological and molecular adaptations of parasitic arthropods that allow them to feed on vertebrate host and facilitate the transmission of vector-borne pathogens. Examines how anthropogenic activities, behaviors, and effects on climate affect the biology of vectors, the pathogens they transmit, and the emergence of vector-borne epidemics in the world. Emphasis on the molecular and physiological interaction between pathogens, their vector, and the vertebrate host and the fundamentals on how vectors and vector-borne pathogens cause disease in humans. Evaluate real control programs deployed globally for the control of vector-borne diseases.",
