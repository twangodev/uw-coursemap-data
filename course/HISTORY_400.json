    "description": "Whatever we do, wherever we go, we are encountering history and reckoning with some consequence radiating out from the past.  Designed to awaken us to the myriad ways in which the past is present all around us, and to help cultivate the historian's habits of mind in our everyday experiences.  In addition to faculty-led group discussions, centers on intellectual opportunities in Madison such as special lecture series and conversations with UW faculty and outside guests.  Themes and topics will vary, depending on the instructor and opportunities for engagement with the wider intellectual community of Madison.",
