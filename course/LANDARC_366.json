Helps students develop fundamental verbal and graphic communication skills used in the professional design world. Questions explored in this course include: How to humans experience their environment? How do we perceive and interact with spaces where we live, work, and play? What makes great interior and exterior spaces? How do designers think to solve creative spatial design problems?",
