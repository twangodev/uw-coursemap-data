    "description": "Mathematical and physical foundations of the application of acoustics in diagnostic ultrasound. Derivation of wave equations for mechanical waves in fluids and solids from a continuum mechanics perspective. Diffraction theory and methods for acoustic field calculation (analytic, angular spectrum, simulations). Review of interactions of acoustic waves with biological tissue and methods to measure their acoustic properties. In-depth discussion of methods for structural image formation including ray-line scanning, plane wave compounding, synthetic aperture, coded excitation, and spatial coherent imaging. Introduction to novel functional imaging approach, including ultrafast Doppler, molecular ultrasound, functional ultrasound, and super-resolution imaging. Application of the acquired knowledge to perform a systematic literature review of the state-of-the-art of the field for the solution of a relevant clinical problem.",
