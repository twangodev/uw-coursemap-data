Career development is a lifelong process that includes tasks and decision-making related to: selecting our dream job at age five, planning our major in college, transitioning to a new field, working as career counselors, and planning for retirement. Surveys foundational and emerging career development theories and interventions. A key component includes exploration of how knowledge from career development scholarship can be applied to students' own lives within a changing socioeconomic context. Requires reflection on personal development (e.g., personalities, identities, life experiences, cultures, interests, skills, needs, and values) and apply this self-knowledge to engage career exploration and planning.",
