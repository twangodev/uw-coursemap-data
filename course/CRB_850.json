    "description": "Gain in-depth knowledge of the fundamentals of stem cell and regenerative biology. This knowledge forms the basis for novel translational research and both diagnostic and therapeutic options. Topics to be covered include the origins of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and how they are being used for both research and for clinical applications. Read, discuss, and present cutting-edge literature on how iPSCs are being used to model a variety of human diseases and how stem cell therapies are being used to treat autoimmune disorders such as Lupus Erythematosus, Multiple Sclerosis, and Crohn's disease. Participate in the Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Center weekly seminar, and hear from top UW researchers about how they are using stem cells to develop therapies for bone and vascular repair.",
