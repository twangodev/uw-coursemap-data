    "description": "Surveys the past 20 years of digital technology and communications culture on the African continent, cross-referenced with discourse on technology experiences in other parts of the developing world, through the framework of development studies. Readings include case studies of micro-tech practices as well as political and social use of new media, and government and NGO-led tech interventions. Information Communication Technology for Development (ICT4D) is a key area of focus. Cross-discipline areas include communications and media studies, African, Latin American and International area studies, as well as the social anthropology of technology and science, and design. Think critically about technology use in the context of different tech cultures from around the world. Apply this perspective towards new media solutions to social problems.",
