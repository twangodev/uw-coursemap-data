    "description": "Develop safe, skilled hip-hop dance execution. Emphasis is placed on applying technique in the improvisational space of the cypher-a sacred circle for exchanging movement knowledge. This space embodies the theory of ritual and play, where ritual is the structure and play is the expressive exchange, ranging from collaborative to competitive. Focuses on cypher training and choreographic retention while exploring hip-hop dance as a cultural and artistic expression. Examine the historical, philosophical, and improvisational roots of Hip-Hop, tracing its lineage through African, Caribbean, and Afro-Latin cultures, as well as its connections to ragtime, swing, and rock n' roll in 20th- and 21st-century America.",
