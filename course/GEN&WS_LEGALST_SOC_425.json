    "description": "Focuses on the intersection between gender, crime and justice from a cross-cultural perspective. The gendered nature of the criminal justice system, female experiences of crime, prosecution and incarceration as well as the extent to which women are victims, offenders, and participants in the criminal justice system will be explored. Special emphasis will be placed on the theoretical implications of offending behavior and the intersection of gender with sexuality, race, ethnicity and class. The goal of this course is to provide a foundation for critically assessing the often controversial issues surrounding race, gender, crime, and criminal justice in society.",
