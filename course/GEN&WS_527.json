Examine how the possibilities for expanding the scope from maternal/fetal health to \"parent/child\" health - where kinship is not strictly about biologic belonging or coming \"straight from the womb,\" but also about love and a safe home or chosen family. Undergirding our analysis is an \"eco-social\" approach, guided by questions of what constitutes \"health,\" access to living a healthy life - in a body and on a planet that feels safe to inhabit.",
