Ductile to brittle transition of crystalline materials such as metals and ceramics, subsurface damage, and residual stress using theoretical development, empirical observation, and molecular dynamics. Knowledge of metal cutting [such asM\u00a0E\u00a0429], materials science [such asM\u00a0S\u00a0&\u00a0E\u00a0350], and manufacturing processes [such asM\u00a0E\u00a0311] required.",
