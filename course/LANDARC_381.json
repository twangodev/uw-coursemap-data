    "description": "Plants as the basis for ecological landscape design in urban and rural settings.   Study plants in their native and designed habitats to understand the relationships between and among plants and their environment in late winter and early spring. Identify the aesthetic, functional, and cultural characteristics of key Wisconsin native plants and plant communities as well as a variety of non-invasive horticultural species.  Discuss how to use plants together in settings with environmental conditions to which they are adapted in order to create resilient and high-performing outdoor spaces that enhance human health and well-being and provide a number of global ecosystem services.",
