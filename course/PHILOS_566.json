We do things intentionally, guide our behavior in light of our reasons, exhibit self-control, and plan for the future. What is it to be an agent, and what makes an event an intentional action? As Wittgenstein put the question, \"What is left over if I subtract the fact that my arm goes up from the fact that I raise my arm?\" Emphasis on contemporary readings, including Donald Davidson and G.E.M. Anscombe.",
