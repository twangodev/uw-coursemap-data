    "description": "Digital media, devices, and networks are deeply embedded in our cultural fabric and are reshaping cultures worldwide. While networks enable instant communication and sharing, they aren't neutral, and their benefits aren't evenly distributed. Examine how digital environments affect global cultures differently, and how local differences shape the use of technology. Explore what being 'global' means in the context of rapid, technologically facilitated changes and analyze how these technologies impact offline experiences within communities based on nationality, region, race, gender, and class.",
