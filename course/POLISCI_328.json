    "description": "Asia is a vibrant region politically and economically, and is very important to the United States for international security and economic stability. Given its importance, this course provides broad and essential knowledge about Asian nations with a particular focus on China, South Korea, North Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines. Country studies are intended to introduce major issues in comparative politics such as democratization, elections, economic development, security, religion and politics. This course will enable students to (1) gain an empirical and analytical understanding of the political dynamics of the region; (2) think comparatively within the regime and across the developing world more generally; and (3) address and debate theoretical questions in political science through Asian politics materials.",
