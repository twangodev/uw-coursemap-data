Examines the relationship between race, ethnicity, and white supremacy as social constructions and connects this to historical and current models of schooling. Explores the concept of settler colonialism and introduces its history in the US and in Wisconsin. Fosters understanding of white supremacy and of formal schooling as national systems that often work to reinforce one another, and of alternative approaches to schooling and society that can foster equity and justice.",
