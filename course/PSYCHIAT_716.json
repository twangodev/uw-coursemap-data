Additional strategies and in-depth opportunities for introspection and self-awareness.  Discussion of relationship-based therapeutic consultation and interventions and attention to the parallel process between the nature of their relationship with a parent and the parent's relationship with their child. Focus will be on underserved populations and contribution of maternal depression, substance abuse disorders and trauma on the parent-child relationship and the child's development. Complex ethical decision making and policy issues will be addressed. Inclusion of a self-assessment process that will support students in appraising their competencies and readiness to apply for the WI Alliance for Infant Mental Health Endorsement.",
