Theoretical frameworks that draw on major health behavior theories provide a better understanding of how individuals, families, peers, schools, neighborhoods, and the larger community influence risk and protective factors. Ethical considerations intrinsic to social and behavioral science efforts designed to produce health-related behavior change will be discussed.
