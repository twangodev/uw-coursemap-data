Social and behavioral science theories and strategies in health promotion/education will be discussed in relation to preventing disease and promoting health. Provides current knowledge and analysis of issues influencing people's health and well-being from a social and behavioral science perspective. Theoretical frameworks that draw on major health behavior theories provide a better understanding of how individuals, families, peers, schools, neighborhoods, and the larger community influence risk and protective factors. Ethical considerations intrinsic to social and behavioral science efforts designed to produce health-related behavior change will be discussed. Promotes intellectual and collaborative learning through course lectures, readings, class discussions, and individual and group work.",
