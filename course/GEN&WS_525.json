    "description": "Examines the contemporary global health project in historical and cultural context, highlighting some of the greatest sources of tension and struggle. Using a feminist lens and focusing on gender as key analytic category, explores the ways that the distribution of global wealth and power impacts health and well-being around the world. Explores social, demographic, political and economic determinants of global health, and the ways that these factors interconnect with biomedicine to create and affect health outcomes, both within and across countries. Drawing on critical theories, situates the study and practice of global health in an intersectional framework.",
