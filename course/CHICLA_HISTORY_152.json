    "description": "Introduction to histories of places that have been called the American West, focusing on the period since 1850. Beginning in the mid nineteenth century, the United States sought to establish power over vast western regions that it claimed on maps but did not in fact control. Moving through the twentieth century to the present day, considers how attention to the American West allows us to reimagine US history more broadly - and how the United States represents just one facet the region's pasts. Learn to think like a historian by analyzing primary sources, evaluating competing narratives, and formulating arguments about the past. Investigate how people, ideas, and infrastructures have transformed a region repeatedly redrawn and consider the ongoing legacies of the past - and the stories we tell about it - in the American West today.",
