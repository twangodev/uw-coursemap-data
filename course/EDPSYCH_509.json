    "description": "Theories of embodied cognition, and related theories of enacted, extended, and embedded cognition, have had increasing influence on general theories of cognition and philosophy of mind, and therefore have importance for education. Featuring interdisciplinary work, with readings and topics drawn from scholarly literature from several fields, including: neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, robotics and artificial intelligence, phenomenology, linguistics, and anthropology. Develop familiarity with the prevailing theories, empirical findings, and methodologies used to investigate ways that the body and body-based processes (such as perception) influence and constitute cognition, and the implications and applications of embodied cognition for education, including learning, assessment, and teaching practices. Apply these theories to research and design projects.",
