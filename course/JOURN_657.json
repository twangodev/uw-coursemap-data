    "description": "Covers fundamental thinking skills necessary for the critical evaluation and presentation of arguments in mass communication, especially those based upon quantitative information. Introduces generic logic and quantitative reasoning concepts through analysis and discussion of specific cases drawn from research reported in the mass media (e.g., health and business news, public opinion polls), research on the media (e.g., the impact of media violence), and research for the media (e.g., audience research). Logical and quantitative reasoning skills will be improved through a variety of \"hands on\" projects.",
