    "description": "Sleep occupies a third of our life, and is found in all animal species. Loss of sleep has both acute and long-term negative consequences on the brain and the body. Still, why we sleep remains unclear, and hypotheses on the role of sleep for synaptic homeostasis, learning and memory, cardiovascular and metabolic health, are being tested in humans and animal models. Learn how the sleeping brain can either support vivid conscious experiences (dreaming) or not (deep slow wave sleep); brain structures involved in wake and sleep; how sleep pressure increases during waking; effects of sleep deprivation; causes of narcolepsy and other sleep disorders. How to study sleep in genetic models like flies; electron microscopy to assess effects of sleep loss on synapses; enhancement of sleep slow waves in humans; development and testing of theoretical models; methods to assess levels of consciousness in humans. During time at the WI Sleep Clinic, learn how sleep disorders are diagnosed and treated.",
