    "description": "In domestic and international policymaking, stark differences between the private sector (the market) and the public sector (the state) are dissolving. The private sector is being pushed to help achieve public policy goals, while the public sector is being pushed to be customer-oriented. Overall focus on the interplay of the public and private sectors in policymaking. Develops an analytic framework and historical context for understanding how the roles and interactions of states and markets have fluctuated across time. Examines how the policymaking \"division of labor\" between states and markets has differed across countries. Examines energy, health, telecommunications, finance, transportation, or other policy areas in which governments are wary about letting markets function without state intervention. Apply concepts from political science, economics, public administration, business, sociology, and other fields in order to understand actual policy choices for various policy issues.",
