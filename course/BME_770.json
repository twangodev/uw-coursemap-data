Fundamentals of recording and processing neural signals using nanoscale synthesis processes and technologies including nanostructured electrodes and their electrical, mechanical, and biochemical properties, active and passive 2D and 3D multielectrode arrays (MEAs), nanoscale transistors for subcellular recordings, nanoparticles, and nano-synthesized agents for recording and stimulating neural activity. Relevant theory of cell electrode coupling, electrophysiology, and neurochemical signaling. Knowledge of microfabrication technologies and biology [such as inB\u00a0M\u00a0E\u00a0550] recommended.",
