    "description": "An introduction to the political economy of development. Why are some countries more economically developed than others?  To help answer this question, examine leading theories of economic development.  In light of these theories, then examine the development experiences of three major regions of the world. Consider a series of issues about development, including the effect of ethnic diversity, corruption, natural resources, and women's empowerment on economic development. Conclude with an examination of the effects of international interactions-via trade, foreign aid, migration, and war-on economic development.",
