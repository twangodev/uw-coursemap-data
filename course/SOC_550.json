    "description": "An introduction to the sociological study of racial orders in comparative and historical perspective. As W.E.B. Du Bois famously wrote, \"The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line,\" but as he also insisted, the social meaning of race is shaped by specific historical and economic contexts. Half of the content focuses on the American experience, especially over the last 50 years, exploring historical and contemporary meanings of race in America, and how racial dynamics have changed (and not changed) across time. The other half continues to explore the American experience, but now using a comparative historical approach, discussing patterns of racial inequality and social change in South Africa and Brazil, both to understand how these issues have played out in those contexts, and to gain new insights into our experiences in the United States.",
