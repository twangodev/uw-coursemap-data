    "description": "Words and rules of combination (grammar) are the two basic building blocks of language. Looks at English words from different linguistic perspectives: As objects of grammar, words follow certain rules of combination (you wouldn't say \"these dog ), but they also have internal structure. For example, a word like \"hopefulness is fine, while \"hopenessful\" does not exist. From a psycholinguistic perspective examine how children learn these formal properties as well as the meaning of words. Study how words are stored in the mind and what one can learn from situations in which one cannot access the mental dictionary properly (for example, when one feels a word is on \"the tip of one's tongue ). From a sociolinguistic perspective,  look at historical and current influences on English vocabulary, including the role of dictionaries and spelling as a source of standardization. Does not require previous knowledge of linguistics.",
