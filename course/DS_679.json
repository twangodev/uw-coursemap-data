    "description": "Future designers need to have critical research knowledge and skillsets that include mastery of various research methods, related issues, and practical experiences in understanding and interpreting quantitative or qualitative research. Design research allows designers to be involved directly with objects, products, and environments they design through human-centered inquiry. The major concepts addressed include design research and its influence on the practice of design, generating research questions, critical literature review, research evaluation, data management and analysis, and various research strategies, all geared toward application to various design practices.",
