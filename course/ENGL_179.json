    "description": "Explores myths and ideologies about English language usage in the US (present and past) from a linguistic perspective. Discusses how common perceptions towards language use and language varieties, especially those associated with ethnic or racial minorities, are socially (not linguistically) constructed. Addresses questions like: Where do linguistic myths, especially those regarding varieties of American English used by persistently marginalized groups, come from and how does one check if there is a factual basis for them? Who gets to decide which words are entered into a dictionary or what constitutes 'proper' English? What perceptions do people have about 'good' and 'bad' dialects and accents? Who benefits and who is harmed by such perceptions? Approaches these and related questions within an anti-racist framework, showing that perceptions towards certain English varieties are often not grounded in linguistic facts but rather in bias against certain demographic groups.",
