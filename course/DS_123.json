    "description": "Design is a key component of our daily lives and can profoundly affect all people. But how? And to what end? What does design mean and what can it do for us? Interrogate those questions by looking broadly at the place of design in everyday life, and how design intersects with society, economics, politics, the environment, and culture. Study the form, function, and philosophy of design, from what we wear on our bodies to how we move through the world. Ground discussions in close observation and analysis of previous design solutions, leading to innovative approaches to the roles, and responsibilities, of design for the future.",
