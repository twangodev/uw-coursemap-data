    "description": "Provides advanced learning opportunities in Endocrinology and Reproductive Physiology areas, particularly reproduction, emphasizing human health whenever possible. Explores scientific questions core to the ERP graduate training program and teaches how to communicate research findings as presentations. Skills developed include information discovery; organization of papers and identification of argument(s); and creation of documents/reports. Students are the driving force behind achievement of the learning objectives by undertaking learning activities, actively engaging in their peers' activities, and providing constructive feedback to their peers. Prior completion ofOBS&GYN\u00a0710recommended but not required.",
