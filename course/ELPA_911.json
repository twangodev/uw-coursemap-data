    "description": "Concentrates on a specific formulation of authentic intellectual work that has a compelling research base. Critical analysis of some of the roots of authentic pedagogy, its research base, its connections to other formulations (critical pedagogy, culturally relevant pedagogy), as well as theoretical perspectives and empirical studies on pedagogy's role in the reproduction of inequality and its possibilities for social justice. Read seminal works on pedagogy and assessment, in the sociology of education, and in critical/post-structural theory applied to teaching, and relate them to both current assessment practices/policies and education leadership.",
