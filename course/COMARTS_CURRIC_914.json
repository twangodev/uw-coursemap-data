    "description": "Video games can be powerful experiences that take us to new worlds, teach us about complex systems, and provoke a range of emotions. Games transform us while we play, and some of these changes can be hard to predict and understand. Games can disrupt our sense of self, reshape our pleasures and feelings, lead us to question deeply held values, and allow us to experience new forms of embodiment through an avatar. A growing body of research in game studies engages with this potential for expansive change by focusing on player experience from a variety of methodological perspectives, including phenomenological, feminist and queer theory, critical disability studies, learning sciences, ecocriticism, and media archeology.",
