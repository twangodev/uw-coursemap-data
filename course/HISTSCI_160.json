    "description": "Offers an introduction to the history of technology centered around the relationship between technology and various forms of social inequality. Addresses: 1) how gendered, racial, and class-based disparities have shaped the history of technology; 2) how forms of engineered inequity have intersected with state-building, colonial projects, environmental degradation, and revolutionary programs; 3) how technology has been implicated in attempts to imagine a more just society. Introduces central themes and concepts in the histories of science, medicine, and especially technology. Examines case-studies that are transnational in scope and move chronologically from the 17th century to the present. Also gives significant attention to histories of technology that originated outside of the U.S. and Europe.",
