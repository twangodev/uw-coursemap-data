    "description": "Building on basic grammar and vocabulary learned in the first semester, this course improves comprehension of literary Chinese prose and poetry as well as the discipline of translation from and into Classical Chinese for students who are native or near- native speakers of modern Chinese. In addition, fundamental background knowledge and reference tools that can aid in the understanding of classical Chinese texts will be introduced. Students improve their own skills in Classical Chinese at the same time as developing materials to aid in the Classical Chinese study of students who are learning the classical and modern language simultaneously.",
