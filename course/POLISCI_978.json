    "description": "Introduction to scholarship on authoritarian regimes and institutions, the most prevalent type of government throughout history. Deals with the conceptual and operational differences between authoritarian and democratic regimes. Discusses autocrats' 'menu of manipulation' to maintain power and minimize both external and internal threats. Focuses on tools such as establishing legislatures, holding elections, controlling the dissemination of information, and power-sharing with political opponents as well as the regime allies. Discusses dictators' strategies to alienate the opposition and to hold power while minimizing external threats from the public, the military, and/or disgruntled political elites. Discusses how and under what conditions autocrats instrumentalize women's rights and on democratic backsliding and the future of global governance.",
