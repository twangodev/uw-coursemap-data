    "description": "In the last three decades, soccer has been transformed from being a very popular game in certain regions of the world to what is now considered a multicultural phenomenon. Soccer has caught the attention of not only the international media but also of disciplines such as sociology, psychology and cultural studies, as well as art forms like photography and filmmaking, digital art and comics. However, more than just a form of entertainment soccer is considered a national sport in most of Latin America. How is it that a game that originated in 19th Century England was adopted by a large and varied culture as a matter of national identity and pride? Focuses on the history of soccer and on soccer as a cultural phenomenon intimately linked to nation building and to notions of progress and national self-image.",
