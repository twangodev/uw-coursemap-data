    "description": "Historical and critical study of the classics of contemporary African and Caribbean literary drama written in English. Thematic issues include the African encounter with Europe, postcolonial disillusionment and the betrayal of ideals, and also stylistic matters as the relationship(s) between traditional drama and other performance forms, and modern drama written in European languages. Considers theories and critical approaches to understanding the cross-continental drama traditions and their contexts. Examines the long histories of cultural, performance, and theatrical relationships between Africa and the Caribbean and how the relationships have been shaped by race and economics, past and present. Considers and questions conventional claims made by others and your own assumptions; stimulates analytical thinking about identity.",
