    "description": "Provides advanced, targeted instruction in reporting that pays close attention to neighborhoods or very small communities (subcommunities), also known as hyperlocal reporting. These small communities can be defined by geographic boundaries or boundaries of shared topical interest. Locate community-based reporting's place in the larger media ecology of mainstream media (newspapers, TV, weekly papers, magazines, independent websites, etc.), and investigate how local journalism's place in changing media ecologies helps (or discourages) people from becoming active citizens in a democracy.",
