    "description": "Explores global health and well-being from a community perspective and through the holistic lens of human ecology. Respectful community-engagement, evidence-based practice, and making the local to global connection are key themes. Almost everything we do has an impact on our own health and that of our communities and the world. Prepares students for community-oriented global health engagement. Consider the nature of community and different types of communities, both locally and globally. Reflect on experiences in communities where you have lived or called home. Review the concept of health and well-being, and evidence-based practice. Learn basic principles of asset-based participatory community research and study, compare and contrast case examples from around the world.",
