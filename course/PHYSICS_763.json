    "description": "Explore the development of quantum computers using specific hardware platforms, such as superconducting qubits. Walk through the entire process from a fabricated device to a functional quantum computer, focusing on qubit tune-up and the DiVincenzo criteria. Implement state preparation and measurement, single and two-qubit gates, and apply quantum characterization, verification, and validation (QCVV) techniques to diagnose and mitigate errors. Utilize quantum computer simulators and real quantum devices when available, leveraging current experimental data analysis methods to understand how to build scalable and reliable quantum systems. Knowledge of quantum mechanics [such asPHYSICS\u00a0531] required.",
