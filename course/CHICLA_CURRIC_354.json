Scholarship from Chicane/Latine Studies, raciolinguistic perspectives, and post/de/anticolonial studies will be examined to critically analyze these school subjects and related hierarchies of knowing, languaging, and being. Applies transdisciplinary perspectives to consider how students, educators, and community activists have challenged those hierarchies and worked to repurpose science, mathematics, and environmental pedagogies toward aims of linguistic, racial, educational, and environmental justice.",
