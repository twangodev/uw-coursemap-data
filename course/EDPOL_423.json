Push collective understanding about the diverse ways that people have conceptualized change, its goals, and the mechanisms through which to produce change around the world. Explore a diverse range of educational approaches (including formal, informal, non-formal, and \"traditional\" educational models) to transforming the world. Draw on a range of disciplinary and sectoral approaches, including education, public health, and public policy; and a broad range of change models, including individual and peer behavior change, social marketing, social movements, chaos theory, and liberation theory.",
