    "description": "Examines the relationships between humans and animals across Asia, exploring cosmological and cultural frameworks as well as modern debates. Examines perspectives from myth, literature, and religion, where ideas about animal symbolism emerge along with concepts of morality, violence, and spiritual kinship with animals. Discusses moral philosophy and critical animal studies, using these perspectives to ethically evaluate issues like animal sacrifice, wildlife trade, animal biotechnologies, zoonotic disease, companion animals, and the ethics of keeping pets and other forms of interspecies intimacy. Considers the impacts of urban expansion, conservation challenges, and the formation of emerging animal rights and justice movements across Asia. How do cultural practices, metaphors, and traditions shape attitudes towards animals? How do people balance economic and ethical responsibilities when it comes to labor, farming, breeding, public health, and environmental challenges?",
