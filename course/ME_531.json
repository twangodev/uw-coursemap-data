    "description": "Broad overview of concepts, methods and tools for manipulating digital geometric models for engineering design and manufacturing. Topics include freeform curves, surfaces, and solid modeling. Topics also include slicing, support generation and path planning for additive and subtractive manufacturing. Provides both cutting-edge knowledge and hands-on project experiences in digital design and manufacturing. It will involve the use of CAD software for creative shape design. It will also involve 3D printers and 3D scanners in the ME Instructional Lab and Maker Space.",
