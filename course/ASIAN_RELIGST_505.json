    "description": "Looking at the cultural institutions of politics, medicine, and religion in multiple cultures and historical times, students will explore ideas about what constitutes a perfect body, how and why different parts of the body are privileged over others, and how and why the notion of bodily perfectibility differs for men and women, children and adults, and humans and gods. Readings encourage such questions as: Is the perfect body attainable and, if so, how? And, who benefits from bodily perfection (or the rhetoric of the bodily perfection)? We will ask these questions with comparative intent: we want both to learn about cultures other than our own and, in the process of understanding the other, we will ask how this new knowledge might empower us to be more observant and critical of the role(s) and treatment of the body in our own society historically and today.",
