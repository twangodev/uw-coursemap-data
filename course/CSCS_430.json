    "description": "Explores the philosophy of fundraising and development, its bearing on the nonprofit sector, as well as the practical strategies employed by nonprofits in their fundraising efforts to secure time, talent and treasure for sustaining their work. Nonprofit sector organizations (NPO) seek to thrive in their efforts to have a positive impact in bringing social change - to individuals, families, and communities and, indeed, the world. To sustain these noble efforts, these dynamic organizations must attract and garner the time, talent and treasure necessary to develop and grow. Fundraising programs are a significant part of a NPO's work in bringing resources to support their fund development/institutional advancement. Development is a mindset - a way to frame the NPO's thinking and behaviors in providing a comprehensive approach to broad mission support.",
