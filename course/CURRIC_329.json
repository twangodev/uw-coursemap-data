    "description": "An opportunity to learn from professional teaching artists, continue to develop practical skills of teaching, and reflect on one's teaching artist practice. Participate in two different teaching artist residencies in order to learn a variety of disciplinary practices. Observe and assist the teaching artists and lead a portion of one class. Engage in collective reflection of residencies and explore relationship to theory. Address classroom challenges and establish the habits of ongoing reflection and effective pedagogical critique. Articulate a personal teaching artist statement, reflect on teaching experiences, and identify ways to make the arts accessible to diverse groups of learners.",
