    "description": "Exploration of civil rights. Question what it means to discriminate (on the basis of race, sex, national origin, religion, and disability), how we might investigate and detect acts of discrimination, and the legal constraints on governmental efforts to remedy discrimination in employment, housing, and voting. Explore the intersection of government power and civil rights. Examine how the government targets groups during times of national crisis. Consider what constitutes acceptable conditions of incarceration for prisoners. Finally, learn police use-of-force doctrine, and discuss the challenge of protecting both officer and civilian safety.",
