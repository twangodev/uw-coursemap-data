    "description": "Examine the historical relationships between metropolitan change, economic transformation, and the construction of race and how those processes have shaped mass incarceration, educational, housing, and income inequality, and the experiences of racial/ethnic minorities who have been marginalized or discriminated against. Key questions include: What is the historical nature of inequality and opportunity in metropolitan America? What policies and ideas have historically promoted inequality, and how have those policies and ideas shifted over time? How have marginalized people responded to inequality, and what impacts have various modes of resistance had? Lastly, what is \"race,\" how has its meaning changed over time, and how has it historically shaped inequality and opportunity?",
