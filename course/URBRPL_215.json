    "description": "We live in an increasingly urban world and anticipate that 70% of the world's population will live in urban areas by 2050. For many of us, our shared future experience will be urban and interconnected. How can we make the future of urban areas as bright as possible for everyone? The answer begins with us. Building equitable and sustainable urban futures for everyone will require the efforts of a diverse group of people from many disciplines, backgrounds, and ways of thinking. Guest presenters introduce different disciplines and perspectives through major themes related to the planning and design of urban systems and environments. Imagine and develop your plan to effect positive change in an urban area focused on relevant topics like community food systems, water conservation, multimodal and active transportation, affordable housing, and urban nature.",
