Broadening access and participation in outdoor recreation requires a clear understanding of this history, as well as an appreciation of the continuing efforts by people of color to reassert their right to the outdoors. Gain a clear understanding of the sociocultural circumstances that have created disparities among the U.S. population in citizens' ability to access and enjoy public land and the efforts that aim to address them.",
