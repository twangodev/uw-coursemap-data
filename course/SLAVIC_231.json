    "description": "What constitutes heroism in the absence of universally shared moral frameworks? Who are we as individuals? What responsibility do we have for the way we represent reality to ourselves and to others? What constitutes \"good life\"? Engage with these questions and examine Polish cinematic tradition from the so-called Polish Film School to the present. Explore key works, themes, and creators of Polish cinema, and probe the ethical and existential dimensions these films open up. Consider various challenges faced by individuals when they lose connection to social, national, political, religious, and existential frameworks that used to define their identity, along with the strategies -- successful or not -- for maintaining one's selfhood and moral integrity in such crises",
