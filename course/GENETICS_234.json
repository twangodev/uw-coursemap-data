    "description": "The sequencing of genomes has transformed our understanding of the evolution of species and human history, our approaches to improve health and medicine, as well as how we tackle global environmental challenges. Explore the many ways in which the sequencing of genomes is revolutionizing our world, and dive into DNA from viral to human genomes. Understand how genomes are expressed, the impact on phenotype, as well as how it can change over time and in different conditions, are processes that are essential for life and the evolution of species.",
