    "description": "Overview of the science behind therapeutic use of psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin and LSD; basic medicinal chemistry of the tryptamine and phenethylamine psychedelics, as well as the neurochemistry and neuropharmacology of their action. Fundamentals of drug development and FDA approval process; Standards of screening and guiding individuals before and during a therapeutic psychedelic session contrasted with the recreational use of these drugs; Appraisal of current clinical research including an objective analysis of risk/benefit for indications such as depression and addiction. History of traditional, ceremonial use of psychedelics, as well as the relationship between recreational use and attempts to regulate and restrict their use. Role of psychedelics in indigenous cultures, impacts of psychedelic tourism and wild-crafting of plants and animals on indigenous peoples.
