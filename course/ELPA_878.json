    "description": "Addresses policies, trends, and debates in the evolution of the American community college from the beginning of the 20th century to the present, as well as current research on the community college and the diverse body of students it serves. Topics include, but are not limited to, governance and administration, faculty and advising, credential completion and transfer, enrollment patterns, developmental education, complexities surrounding students' goals and aspirations, and the cooling-out versus warming-up effect of the community college. Through class discussions and the culminating course project (research study or policy proposal), course participants will engage in a critical, scholarly examination of the American community college, considering its strengths and weaknesses, as well as opportunities and challenges within the broader context of education.",
