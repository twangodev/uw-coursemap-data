    "description": "An introduction to ergodic theory and dynamics on the moduli space of translation surfaces with applications to counting problems in rational billiards and on flat surfaces. Covers dynamical techniques inspired by homogeneous dynamics including the use of Margulis functions to establish quantitative recurrence results; the use of random walks, inspired by work of Benoist and Quint, to prove measure rigidity statements; and the use of Zimmer's theory of the algebraic hull to prove finiteness results.",
