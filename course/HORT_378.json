    "description": "This international field study will meet during the winter intercession in a tropical country in Central America. Reflect on the role of plants in our daily lives and the effects that our daily choices have on the environment, human health, conflicts, poverty, and development. Provides an opportunity to develop a holistic appreciation of horticulture by highlighting the interactions between plants and society. Discuss some of the social, scientific and environmental challenges that conventional, sustainable and organic horticulture practices face in the production, marketing, and use of tropical crops. The field study will provide an opportunity to contextualize what was learned during \"Tropical Horticultural Systems\" (HORT/\u200bAGRONOMY\u00a0\u00a0376). Visit diverse agricultural systems, such as small farms, large-scale operations, market growers, and industrial export businesses. In addition, we will visit agronomic centers, botanical gardens, herbaria, germplasm banks, and nature preserves.",
