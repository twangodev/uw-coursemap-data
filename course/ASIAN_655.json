    "description": "From Greek ethnos, \"folk\" + grapho, \"to write,\" doing ethnography involves writing about people, societies, and cultures. It is a qualitative, rather than a quantitative, type of research. One does ethnography, and thus it's a process.  But an ethnography is also a product: the outcome of the ethnographic process is an ethnography. In-depth studies and discussions of classic and contemporary ethnographies in multiple Asian contexts that focus on themes like religion, health, economics, and sexuality in writing, photography, and film at once illustrate various methods involved in doing ethnography and illuminate why scholars have for decades studied and represented Asia through ethnography. The methods of ethnography are never divorced from the motivations of the scholars, and thus it is crucial to probe critically and collectively what ethnography is (theory), how it is done (practice), and why is it worth doing generally and in Asian contexts in particular.",
