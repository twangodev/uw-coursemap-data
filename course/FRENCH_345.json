    "description": "Study of French literary texts embedded in their cultural contexts, with a focus on clothing and fashion. Chart the emergence and representation of sartorial taste in France through analysis and discussion of selected texts and other media that feature clothing as a reflection of aesthetic and social values. Rather than evidence for material and economic history, literature and the visual arts will be ways to touch on issues such as the evolution of the notion of human physical beauty, of taste, of gender differences and roles, of social status and stratification in different historical contexts.",
