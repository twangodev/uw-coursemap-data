    "description": "Drawing from cultural studies, border studies, migration and race theory, explores through cultural and literary texts the social and political issues regarding migration, contact zones, transculturation, and/or diaspora. Considers the various meanings of the word \"border\" or \"frontera\". What is a border geographically speaking? What does it mean in political and legal terms? How do we conceive the border in cultural, literary, linguistic, political, judicial, and personal ways? What is like to live on the border or on the margins? It is said that the border is a contact zone, a meeting point, a way to transfer and share information, an invitation to (in)tolerance and ex/inclusion. Read texts from history, politics, cultural anthropology, literature, and theatre to grasp the vast understanding of what is life on the border. Focus on the humanities, paying close attention to how visual artists (theater, performance, documentaries) understand and confront life on the border.",
