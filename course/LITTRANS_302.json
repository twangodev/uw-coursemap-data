    "description": "Explores representations of biological life in literature, scientific discourse, film, and art. The symbolic representations (metaphors and similes used by scientists, fictions narrated by writers, and pictorial forms imagined by artists) allow students to analyze diverse conceptualizations of biological life: life as mechanism, rhythmic movement, balance of energy, inherent force, resistance to death, death's complementary cycle. The exploration of biological life's attributes, such as plasticity, limitedness, and self-consciousness, fosters interdisciplinary thinking bridging the humanities and life sciences. The symbolic representations of life are studied through different genres of texts and different media, and at different moments of cultural history. The texts and media will be from around the world (with a particular emphasis on French, francophone and Italian sources), but studied in English translation.",
