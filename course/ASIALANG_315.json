In addition, fundamental background knowledge and reference tools that can aid in the understanding of classical Chinese texts will be introduced. Students improve their own skills in Classical Chinese at the same time as developing materials to aid in the Classical Chinese study of students who are learning the classical and modern language simultaneously. Not open to students with credit for E ASIAN 321 prior to Fall 2019.",
