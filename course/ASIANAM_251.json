    "description": "Focuses on recently arrived Asian immigrant groups and historically excluded groups to highlight their exclusion from mainstream Asian America. Covers how Asian American-based identity politics has reduced the experiences of these groups to categorical understandings of race, citizenship, nationality, class, immigration, and others. Uses intersectional lens to analyze their experiences with the goal of expanding what it means to be \"Asian American.\" Lastly, examines how Asian American-based identity politics has influenced conversations around higher education, politics, and race relations.",
